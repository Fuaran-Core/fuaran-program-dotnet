# DECISIONS.md — fuaran-program

Standing design decisions for the program domain. Each is binding until explicitly superseded
here. (Decision provenance beyond this repo's scope is recorded at the maintainers' workspace
level.)

## D1 — Pipeline core; richer control structure is vocabulary, not evaluator (2026-07-31)

The algebra's core is minimal and fixed: **sequencing + typed branching + named effects**.
Statecharts (states / transitions / guards), workflows, and other control-structure idioms are
expressed as *vocabulary atop the core* — node kinds that lower to it — never as alternative
evaluators. Rationale: the core matches the handler decomposition every host actually performs
(validate → read → compute → mutate → respond); a second evaluator would fork the totality and
safety analysis. Deciding statechart-primary later would force a rewrite of every interpreter;
deciding pipeline-primary later would not, which is why the pipeline wins now.

## D2 — Total, not Turing-complete (2026-07-31)

The program language is **total**: structural recursion over finite data and bounded iteration
(a repeat whose count is a literal or a validated-range parameter) are permitted; general
(non-structural) recursion is forbidden. Genuinely unbounded computation exits through the
explicitly-effecting host-function tier (D3), which the effect signature segregates. Rationale:
totality is what makes a program tree checkable *before* execution, safe for machine emission,
and hostable on shared infrastructure — bounded code + bounded cost. Losing it would forfeit the
domain's reason to exist; no expressiveness argument outranks that.

## D3 — Closed per-placement effect vocabularies; host-seam extension only (2026-07-31)

Each placement of the program loop (a browser client, a server session, any future host) carries a
**closed DU** of effects its interpreter can emit. Extensibility comes from **registered,
policy-gated host performers** behind a default-deny gate — never from widening the wire
vocabulary ad hoc. Rationale: a closed vocabulary is what keeps the effect signature auditable, a
program's capability envelope declarable, and the default-deny gate meaningful. A program can
*name* only effects its host registered; a genuinely novel capability is a host act, and the
program's reach extends only after registration.

## D5 — The dependency runs one way: this domain consumes the UI tier, never the reverse (2026-08-15)

> **Amended by D18 (2026-09-27) — the direction clause.** Only the closing sentence, "the direction
> is re-examined at the D4 generic-tier cut", is superseded; D18 is that re-examination. Everything
> else in this entry stands as written, including "no `Fuaran.UI.*` package references
> `Fuaran.Program.*`".

The bounded interpreter moved here **whole**: the interpreter, the binding re-resolution pass, and
the server placement of the loop that drives them all live in `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`. The
alternative — leaving the server loop in the UI tier's server-driven package and having that package
consume this one — was considered and **refused**.

The reason is not taste. The interpreter needs the UI tier's types, so it must depend on the UI tier
(D4). Had the UI tier's server-driven package then depended back on this one, that package would
carry, in a single compilation, a project reference to the UI types *and* a transitive package
reference to a differently-built copy of the same types — the version-skew class that surfaces as a
cast failure at runtime rather than an error at build time. It would also make every change to the
UI types a two-repo round trip (pack the UI tier, rebuild and pack this repo, rebuild the UI tier)
on the more actively developed of the two.

So: **`Fuaran.Program.*` consumes published `Fuaran.UI.*` packages; no `Fuaran.UI.*` package
references `Fuaran.Program.*`.** This repo stays buildable from a cold clone against published
packages alone, and the package graph stays acyclic.

The consequence is recorded honestly: the UI tier's server-driven package **no longer ships the
bounded interpreter or the bounded loop**. That is a removal from its public surface, taken as a
pre-1.0 minor bump, and consumers of the bounded path take a reference to this package instead. The
direction is re-examined at the D4 generic-tier cut, when the witness-generic contract may remove the
UI-type dependency altogether.

## D4 — First instantiation is UI-typed; the generic tier waits for a second domain (2026-07-31)

> **Amended by D18 (2026-09-27) — the timing clause.** "cut only when a second domain instantiation
> materialises" is superseded: the cut is taken now, as a design decision. Everything else in this
> entry stands, including its warning, which D18 answers by naming each assumption it keeps.
>
> **Standing note, 2026-10-01 (Phase 1967).** A second domain instantiation now EXISTS, privately: a
> domain whose handler is a store-mutating verb, run under the unmodified 0.6.0 core. The contract
> admitted it without change and the run was correct, which is the half of this entry's warning that
> did not come true. The other half did: 25 of the contract's 31 members were vacuous or unfillable
> at those types, and three gaps forced the domain to build machinery beside Program that belongs in
> it — no member projected an op's reach, no shape of the view halted, and Program performed nothing
> of an op. D19 is the answer to each; `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.10 is the finding written out.

The domain is chartered now, as a design decision — its identity, name, wire-family destiny, and
package surface are sovereign from birth. Its **first instantiation is UI-typed**: the bounded
interpreter proven in the UI tier's server-driven packages moves here and is consumed against the
UI tier's types. The **witness-generic contract** (the abstraction that lets any Fuaran domain
instantiate the algebra over its own types) is cut only when a second domain instantiation
materialises — a single-witness abstraction bakes its witness's assumptions in, so generalisation
is timed empirically even though the domain's existence is not. Consequence: `Fuaran.Program.*`
packages may reference published `Fuaran.UI.*` packages during this stage; the dependency
direction is re-examined at the generic-tier cut.

## D6 — `fuaran.program/logic-tree` is the by-id reference vocabulary for placing a program tree (2026-08-22)

A composition surface that carries a program tree holds it in an **opaque slot under the namespaced
id `fuaran.program/logic-tree`** and refers to it by that id rather than by structural position, so
the two sides agree on a name without either taking a type dependency on the other.

## D7 — Call recognition is an arm of the shared fold, and a placement supplies only the answer (2026-08-22)

A **call action is recognised by the shared interpreter**, at whatever depth it appears, and the
placement supplies only what a call *means* there — through a `HandlerArm` the fold consults. The
server-logic placement's earlier shape, where the loop matched the top-level action itself and looked
up an endpoint before reaching the fold, is retired.

The reason is D1, read the other way round. Recognising a call nested inside a chain requires knowing
where in the chain it sits, and only the fold knows that; a placement that reached into the action
tree to find one would be matching on `Action` a second time, which is a second evaluator in
everything but name. So the choice was never "top-level or nested" — it was "one evaluator with a
seam, or two evaluators". Moving the arm into the fold also makes the property checkable rather than
asserted: exactly one site in the domain *interprets* an action, and the server package matches on an
`Action` nowhere at all — a test greps for it, so restoring a special case there means deleting an
assertion that says not to. (Two other walks match the same closed DU without interpreting it: the
resource budget's cost accounting and the demanded-effect projection's static enumeration. Neither
performs, mutates or resolves anything, which is the distinction D1 actually draws.)

The consequence to state plainly is that a nested call is now **spliced in place**: it sees the writes
declared before it and is seen by the writes after it, because the fold threads one store through
them all. That is the behaviour a reader would have assumed; before this decision it was silently a
no-op, which is the worse of the two failures because nothing announced it.

**What it forecloses.** A placement can no longer give a call action a meaning that depends on where
it sits — the fold decides *when* the arm is consulted, and hands it a store, a node id and an
endpoint, nothing else. A placement wanting "only the outermost call counts" would have to argue for
it here rather than implement it locally.

**The one boundary drawn deliberately:** a call action *inside a handler stage* runs against the
INERT arm, so it is the documented no-op. A handler's stages are host-registered data whose
capability envelope is fixed before any untrusted tree arrives, and handler composition is therefore
a host act — registering the stages you want — not something a call buried in a stage may smuggle in.
It is also what keeps D2 true structurally: were a stage's call to re-enter the registry, a handler
naming itself would not terminate, and totality would rest on a resource budget instead of on the
shape of the thing.

## D8 — Host-effect atomicity is TWO-PHASE STAGING (2026-08-22)

The design note left three ways to close the gap between the handler's total domain-state atomicity
and its non-total host-effect atomicity: compensation, constrained host calls, or two-phase staging.
**Two-phase staging is chosen.** A handler run is a PLAN phase, in which every stage executes and each
`HostCall` is gated, resolved to a performer and checked for a legal landing slot but **not invoked**,
followed by a PERFORM phase, reached only if the plan completed, in which the staged calls are invoked
in declaration order.

It is chosen on the note's own arguments. Compensation doubles the authoring burden and makes a
handler's correctness depend on an author writing a correct inverse, which is the failure mode
compensating transactions are known for. Constraining `HostCall` to reads forecloses the case the
escape hatch exists for (D2's genuinely unbounded computation), which frequently *is* a write —
paying for atomicity by deleting the capability. Staging needs no new authoring vocabulary at all: a
handler that was correct before this decision is correct after it, and the property arrives for free
at every existing handler rather than at the ones someone remembers to annotate.

**Only the arm that commits outside is staged, and that is the honest boundary.** Of the five server
effects, `RunQuery` reads, `ApplyOps` edits an in-memory tree the caller may discard, and `EmitPatch`
and `Notify` accumulate as values the host performs after the handler returns — none of them can be
"performed too early" because none of them is performed by the handler at all. `HostCall` is the only
arm that reaches outside, so it is the only one deferred. Deferring the reads as well would have been
a purer reading of the note's wording and a worse decision: it would break the read → compute → mutate
shape that is the entire reason a handler is a stage list.

**What it forecloses, and what it does not close.**

- **A later stage cannot read an earlier host call's result.** This is the cost the note named, and it
  is now structural rather than discouraged: at planning time there is no result to read. A handler
  needing that shape is two handlers, or a host function that does both halves.
- **A performer that fails in the PERFORM phase leaves its predecessors run.** Staging moves the
  boundary; it does not abolish it, and no fold can. What changed is the size and the reporting: the
  residual is now at most a prefix of the declared host calls, it can no longer be triggered by a
  domain failure, and the outcome names it — `Committed = false` with `Performed` listing exactly the
  calls that happened, plus a `PerformFailed` diagnostic distinct from the planning-phase `Failed`.
  An uncommitted handler reporting a non-empty `Performed` is that case and only that case.
- **`Performed` is execution order, not stage order.** A host call declared first appears last,
  because that is when it ran. Reading it as a stage list would be reading it as a declaration, and it
  is an audit trail.

The handler-as-atomicity-unit guarantee is unchanged: `Committed` still says which of the two
outcomes a caller got, a halt still discards the store, ops, patches, notifications and effects in
favour of the entry state, and the op sink is still called once, after the handler, never per stage.

**Mechanism reference (Phase 1717).** The three clauses above are machine-checked in
`proofs/Staging.fst` — `plan_pure` (nothing external runs in the plan phase),
`residual_is_prefix` (on failure at position k the outcome is the entry state and `Performed` is
exactly the first k staged calls), `performed_in_order` and `commit_is_total_prefix` — over every
staged sequence and every point of failure, with the performer abstract; the differential host in
`tests/Fuaran.Program.Server.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs` runs the extraction beside `Handler.run`.
The claims ladder in `proofs/README.md` says what that does and does not cover.

## D9 — The HANDLER declares where its results land; a tree-declared result target is refused (2026-08-22)

A program tree's call action can carry a result target, and a handler's stages name their own landing
slots. Two mechanisms for one job is one too many. **The handler's wins**, and the tree's is not
merely ignored — the shared fold **refuses** a call action that declares one, at every placement, with
a log-safe diagnostic naming neither the endpoint nor the target. The demanded-effect projection stops
projecting it for the same reason.

The note framed the trade as the reader's view (the tree says where the answer goes, keeping the
handler reusable) against the writer's view (the handler says, keeping the contract in one place).
Two things decide it here, and neither is about taste.

**The tree is untrusted; the handler is not.** This whole placement rests on a session's capability
envelope being fixed before any generated tree arrives — the host registers the handlers, the tree can
only name one. A tree-declared landing slot punctures exactly that: it lets an emitted tree choose
where a privileged handler's answer is written, including into a slot some other part of the tree
reads. The host-reserved-namespace check would then be guarding a wire-carried string rather than a
host-declared one, which is a materially weaker position for the same code.

**And it is under-expressive besides.** A handler has several stages that land results — a query
names its slot, each host call names its own — so one target on the call action cannot address them.
The mechanism that lost could not have done the job even if it were safe.

The reusability the reader's view buys is recoverable and cheap: a host registers the same stage list
under two endpoints with different landing slots. That is a host act, which is where every other
capability decision in this domain already sits.

**What it forecloses.** A tree can no longer parameterise a handler at all — not its landing slot, and
by the same argument not anything else it might later have carried. A future case for tree-supplied
parameters is a case for a declared, validated parameter vocabulary with a host-side schema, and it
has to be made here; it cannot arrive as a field the fold quietly starts honouring.

**Refusal rather than silence is the load-bearing half.** Ignoring the target would leave an author
believing an answer lands somewhere it never does, and would leave the retired mechanism looking alive
to anyone reading the wire vocabulary. This costs nothing today, because no bounded placement ever
honoured the target: it has been inert since the interpreter was written, and refusing it merely says
so out loud.

## D10 — The reader's expectation is DECLARED, and the declaration already exists (2026-08-22)

A query lands a table in a named slot and some node reads it. To check the two against each other
before anything runs, the check needs an expectation to compare the derived output schema against.
The design note left two ways to get one: the reading slot gains a **declared schema** (typed,
checkable, more to author), or the expectation is **inferred from the accessor** (no authoring cost,
and inference across a wire boundary is where inference stops being cheap). **Neither of those two
ships**, and the reason is worth more than the answer.

**Inference from the accessor is not expensive across the wire; it is EMPTY across the wire.** A
query binding's accessor is a closure, and a closure does not survive decoding — the decoder
substitutes an identity projection, so on a decoded tree the accessor says nothing whatsoever about
columns. Inference would work only on a hand-authored tree, which is precisely the tree that does not
need this check: the check exists because a *generated* tree arrived and the host would like to know,
before running it, whether its own queries can serve it.

**A declared slot schema was refused for D9's reason: the tree already declares this.** A chart names
its `xField` and its `yFields`; a grid column names its `field`; a grid names its `rowKeyField`. Those
are ordinary wire-carried strings, not closures, and they are the whole of what the render vocabulary
reads from a row. Minting a second declaration beside them would be two mechanisms for one job — and
the new one would be the one free to drift, because nothing renders it.

**So the expectation is DECLARED, by the reading node's existing fields, and the walk HARVESTS that
declaration rather than inferring one.** The distinction is not pedantry: reading a string an author
wrote is a different act from deducing what an author meant, and only the first has a defined answer
when it is wrong. Where a reader's projection *is* closure-held — a grid column with no `field`, whose
content is the closure; a closure row key — the harvested expectation is a **lower bound**, reported as
such and never completed by a guess.

**The `Ref` half is the same shape one layer down: the host declares, at registration, beside the
resolver that serves the rows.** The tempting alternative was to *resolve* the source and read the
schema off the table. It is refused: this family exists to answer a question before anything external
runs, and a check that calls a host's data resolver to decide whether a handler may run has already run
half the handler. An undeclared source degrades to "unknown" — reported, never guessed, and never a
refusal, because refusing a handler over a schema nobody declared would punish a host for not answering
a question it was never asked.

**Only a PROOF is a finding.** The walk refuses on what it can demonstrate — a column the query
provably does not produce, a step reading a column its input provably lacks, a union whose two sides
provably disagree — and everything it merely cannot decide is DATA on the report: a query whose output
is not statically closed (a pivot names its value columns from the data; an undeclared `Ref` names
nothing), and a reader whose projection is closure-held. That is `OpaqueHandlers`' choice, taken again
for its reason: a finding that fires on ordinary correct trees is one people learn to scroll past, and
then the real ones go with it.

**The runtime posture is untouched.** The dispatch-time diagnostic still carries the evaluation error's
discriminator and nothing else, because it is still the thing that runs while a wire-carried pipeline is
in scope. What changed is that the detailed error now exists *somewhere* — before the untrusted tree is
involved, where names cost nothing.

**What it forecloses.** A reader can only ever state a column expectation the RENDER vocabulary spells.
A node that needs a column for something other than display has no way to say so, and giving it one is
the declared-slot-schema option arriving by another door — it has to be argued here, not added as a
field the walk quietly starts reading. Recorded as an open gap rather than a limitation resolved: a
binding that TRANSFORMS a query slot client-side is a reader whose expectation is this walk composed
with its own pipeline, and that composition is not attempted.

## D11 — The evaluation suite lives outside this repository

**2026-08-22.**

A companion **evaluation suite** for this domain exists: a corpus of
program-emission tasks put to a model, whose emissions are gated by this
repository's own shipped machinery — the handler wire decoder, the
demanded-coverage check, the replay classification — with the refusal class each
produces carried through unedited. It does **not** live here, and the reason is
worth recording rather than leaving a reader to wonder where the tests went.

An evaluation suite names things this repository cannot. It pins model
identifiers and provider vocabulary; it consumes packages that are not published;
its corpus and its stored result cells carry both freely. This repository is
Apache-2.0 and written for an outside reader, and none of that belongs beside a
licence that invites the world to read it. So the suite sits in a **sibling
repository**, and what crosses the boundary is one-way: it consumes the
`Fuaran.Program.*` packages, and nothing here references it. Its location is a
maintainers' workspace concern, like the other cross-repo conventions this file
declines to ship.

**What this repository owes it is a forward-coupling obligation, not a
dependency.** The suite's whole design rests on the gate being *this* domain's:
its corpus's repair tier hands a model whatever the shipped decoder says about a
broken emission, its census clusters on the specification's own refusal classes,
and its provenance stamps name the codec assembly's version. So a change to the
refusal vocabulary, to the closed effect vocabularies, or to what a coverage
finding says is a change to what that suite measures — visible to it immediately
and to nobody here. That is the correct direction (a measured thing should not
have to know about its instrument), and it is why the obligation is recorded as a
decision rather than assumed.

**Why the boundary is drawn at the repository and not at a folder.** The
structured-document domain in this family reached the same conclusion and could
implement it as a folder, because its parent directory already held several
repositories with room beside them. This repository *is* its directory:
there is nowhere inside it that is not inside the publishable artefact. A sibling
is therefore the only shape that satisfies the boundary, not merely the tidiest.

## D12 — The durable interpreter journals the ONE arm that reaches outside, and the indeterminate window is DECLARED rather than closed (2026-08-25)

A second interpreter of the same server-placement algebra runs handlers under **deterministic replay
over an effect journal**. Three things about it are decisions rather than implementation detail, and
each forecloses something.

**It calls the stage fold; it does not fork it.** `Durable.run` supplies a registry whose performers
consult the journal and then invokes `Handler.run`. The alternative — a second fold that journals as
it goes — was refused for D1's reason read one level up: two folds over one stage vocabulary is a
second evaluator of the handler algebra, kept in step by hand, and the parity claim between the two
interpreters would then be a coincidence somebody has to maintain rather than a property of the code.
The consequence is that the durable interpreter cannot change *when* a stage runs, only what a host
call means the second time round. A discipline needing a different phase order would have to argue for
it here.

**Only `HostCall` is journaled, and that follows from D8 rather than from convenience.** Of the five
arms, four never leave the interpreter: a query reads, an op edits an in-memory tree the caller may
discard, and a patch and a notification accumulate as values the caller performs after the handler
returns. A re-run cannot perform any of them twice because it does not perform them at all — it
RECOMPUTES them, from the entry state, which is what makes deterministic replay worth having rather
than an extra ledger to keep. So the exactly-once claim this placement makes is about **what it
performs**; what a caller does with a returned notification is the caller's own delivery posture, and
the composition joins the two rather than this package asserting it.

**The indeterminate window is not closed, and no configuration hides it.** A step is journaled twice —
attempted before the effect, decided after — so a crash leaves three readable states, and the third is
"attempted, no result": the effect may have happened and may not. It cannot be resolved here, because
the effect commits in a system this host does not own and the journal is a second system, and no
ordering of two writes to two systems is one transaction. **The default is to REFUSE the replay of such
a step**, on the same argument `Replay.strict` makes; `acceptingIndeterminateReplay` is the named
opt-in that re-invokes instead, and it returns an override record so a resume that overrode is
afterwards distinguishable from one that never needed to.

What that buys is the honest facet. A host call reaches `ExactlyOnceEffective` only where the host has
DECLARED the performer idempotent (or deduplicated by a store, and configured re-invocation); an
undeclared performer reaches it under no configuration, because strict refusal may lose the call and
re-invocation may duplicate it and neither of those is exactly-once. **The conjunction is stated over
the delivery HAZARD** — may lose, may duplicate — rather than over the three named facets, because the
named set is not closed under combination: a registration can prove both hazards, and the honest answer
there is that no facet says it, not whichever of the two reads better. A declaration may promise less
than the derivation; a declaration that promises more is refused, per axis. That asymmetry is the rule,
not an omission — a conservative promise costs only the promise.

**What it forecloses.** The step ordinal is derived from the fold, so a journal entry addresses a
position and not a name. A replay whose recomputation stages a different call list therefore REFUSES at
the first ordinal whose capability disagrees, rather than serving one call's recorded answer to another.
Making replay robust to a genuinely divergent recomputation would need steps to carry stable identities
of their own, which is a wire question and has to be argued rather than added.

## D13 — An out-of-band tree edit is a SEPARATE, default-closed entry point, and its refusal is a type of its own (2026-09-02)

**2026-09-02.**

`BoundedConnection` makes a bounded session servable, and with a servable session comes a question
the loop had not had to answer: may a tool *outside* the interaction loop — a tree inspector or
editor — submit a `TreeOp` against the session's tree? Four sub-decisions, each of which had an
obvious alternative that is wrong for a stated reason.

**It is a separate entry point, not a widened event.** The inbound event type is a closed
*interaction* vocabulary whose meaning is "the user interacted with node X", which the loop resolves
to an action and folds over the store. A tree op is categorically different: it mutates structure
directly, bypassing that fold. Carrying it as an event would have meant either a payload that can
encode arbitrary structure — collapsing the closure-free portable subset the whole inbound seam rests
on — or a second meaning smuggled into one type. `ApplyOutOfBand` is a distinct member, so nothing
about the interaction path changes shape.

**It exists on THIS loop and must not be added to a model-projection loop.** The bounded session's
`BaseTree` is fixed structural state, so an op applied to it re-resolves, diffs and lowers through
the ordinary path, and later interactions resolve against the edited tree. Where the tree is a
projection of a model, the next step's diff *reverts* the edit — so the same entry point there would
apply, appear to work, and silently snap back on the user's next click. That is a property of the two
loops rather than a gap in one, and the correct expression of an edit that must survive there is a
model change, which a tree op cannot express.

**Its refusal is its own type, not a case on `BoundedReject`.** The tempting move is to add a case,
and it is wrong twice. `BoundedReject` documents itself as the EVENT-level refusal and nothing else,
and an out-of-band edit is not an event; and it is a closed DU that a host matches exhaustively, so
widening it breaks every such match — a breaking change, taken to model something the type says it
does not model. `OutOfBandRefusal` is additive, and the two vocabularies stay legible as the
different facts they are.

**Its gate is a connection-level opt-in that fails closed, not a widened services record.** The
existing dispatch gate is typed over the interaction action and cannot express an attributed tree op,
so it could not have served; and adding a field to the services record would break every full-literal
construction of a public type. Installing a grant policy is therefore a member on the connection, and
an absent policy refuses everything — the same default `BoundedServices.create` takes for dispatch,
and for the same reason: this loop runs trees it does not trust, on infrastructure it shares.

**Attribution is carried and never believed.** The submitter's actor string is a claim made over a
channel the session did not authenticate. It is handed to the grant policy and echoed on the refusal
so a host can record it *beside* the principal it did authenticate, never in place of it. Anything
stronger would be the loop asserting an identity nothing established.

**What this forecloses, deliberately.** The refusal is returned to the caller rather than pushed to
the client, because the transport seam is push-frames outbound and fire-and-forget inbound: there is
no correlation id and no response envelope, so a refusal routed into a patch frame would be a
response smuggled through a broadcast. Delivering one to a *remote* submitter needs a correlated
response leg on the seam, which is the UI tier's to add and a wire change when it comes.

## D14 — When the witness-generic tier is cut, the model is written first; the evaluator is hand-written against it, and nothing extracted ships (2026-09-14)

**2026-09-14.**

D4 defers the witness-generic tier until a second domain instantiates the algebra. Phase 1715
brings this repository a `proofs/` kernel on the precedent the Core repository established — a
pinned F\* release, a model captioned clause for clause against the F#, the model extracted to F# and
run as a differential oracle beside production, and a README whose claims ladder is the only place
"formally verified" appears. That kernel is model-after-code, because the bounded fold it models
already exists. The generic tier is the one kernel in this domain that does not exist yet, so the
order of authorship is genuinely open, and it is decided here, before anyone writes a line of either.

**The model is written first.** When the generic tier is cut, its F\* model is authored from the
program wire specification's execution semantics and schemas before any evaluator code, and its
totality, its no-closure-invocation law and the `Chain` homomorphism are proved before the evaluator
is started. An algebra that is not total is cheapest to discover at that moment: the Core repository
found a validator hole with a machine-checked counterexample only after the code had shipped, and
had to file the fix as a separate phase. Here the theorem is the specification the evaluator is
written to meet.

**Nothing extracted ships, and the reason is performance, not purity.** The extracted model is the
oracle and only the oracle, exactly as the Core repository holds it. A model is shaped for the
prover: sets are lists walked by membership, recursion is fuelled by a list so termination is
manifest, there is no early exit and no tuned structure anywhere. That is right for a differential
host and wrong for this domain's evaluator, which is the inner loop of every server handler and every
client interaction, and which must also Fable-compile and run in the browser. Shipping it would also
delete the differential — with production equal to the extraction there is nothing left to compare,
and the F\* code generator, a second-class backend upstream, would join the product's trusted base
rather than the proof leg's. So the evaluator is hand-written against the model, the model is
extracted as the oracle, and the differential is what holds the two together.

**What this forecloses, deliberately.** No file under `proofs/oracle/` reaches a packed assembly; a
change that adds a reference from any `src/` package to the oracle project is refused on that ground
alone, whatever else it does. And the proof programme adds no cost on a production path: a theorem
whose closing would require restructuring the evaluator halts with the obstruction recorded in the
claims ladder, rather than reshaping the code it is about. The proofs exist to show the algebra is
robust, not to make the interpreter a chore to implement or slower to run.

## D15 — The signed effect envelope is verified by RECOMPUTATION; the signature attests the pairing, never the effects; the signer is the host's, by shape (2026-09-15)

**2026-09-15, Phase 1744.**

`Demanded.ofTree` and the server placement's `ofTreeAndHandlers` already answer "what can this
program ever ask for" as a document that can be stored where the tree never travels. Nothing signed
it, so a deployer handed a tree and an envelope held a claim, not evidence. `SignedEnvelope.sign`
signs the pair (canonical tree hash, demanded document bytes); `SignedEnvelope.verify` checks it.
Three choices in how, each made against the obvious alternative.

**The envelope is recomputed, never trusted from the signature.** A verifier decodes the tree,
re-derives the envelope through the same total walk, compares, and only then checks the signature —
over the preimage it just recomputed, never over the bytes it was handed. The alternative — check
the signature over the carried bytes and, if it holds, believe them — is what a signature usually
buys, and it is refused here because it would make the envelope's contents a matter of trust in the
signer's reading of the tree. They need not be: the walk is total and the vocabulary closed, so a
verifier can produce the envelope itself, and a document the verifier can produce is proof-carrying
data rather than testimony. The consequence is stated in the type: `verify` returns the RECOMPUTED
projection, and a consumer checking coverage afterwards does so against that, not against the
carried bytes.

**The signature attests pairing, not effect-safety.** What recomputation cannot give is that a named
key vouched for THIS tree paired with THIS envelope, and that is all the signature adds. It says
nothing about whether the demanded effects are acceptable; that remains `Demanded.check`'s question,
asked of a host's coverage, afterwards. A signed envelope naming a dangerous effect verifies
perfectly — the point is that the effect is NAMED, in a document the host can refuse on, rather than
discovered at dispatch. The three failures are therefore three facts: `EnvelopeDrift` (the document
does not describe this tree; a tree whose effects exceed its envelope is this, with the excess
enumerated), `BadSignature` (the document is exact, but the pair is not the one the signer made —
both tree hashes are carried so "the tree moved without moving a demand" reads differently from
"the bytes are forged"), and `ForeignKey` (the record names a key the verifier was not offered). A
verify with NO key is a fourth refusal, `NoKey`, and not a skip: a check that quietly degrades to
"the envelope matches" when no key is supplied is the check an operator believes they ran and did
not.

**The signer is the host's, consumed by shape, and no cryptography enters this repository.** Signing
goes through `Fuaran.Core.IAttestationSink`, the synchronous attestation seam the substrate already
carries — it signs an opaque string and answers with a key id and a signature, and the key never
crosses it. Verification takes the public key as the UI tier's `KeyDirectoryEntry` and the crypto
as its `IClaimSignatureVerifier`, whose ECDSA P-256 instance already exists there for .NET hosts.
The tree hash is the tier's Fable-clean SHA-256 over the tier's canonical encoding, so the preimage
is the same bytes on every runtime the interpreter runs on and `Fuaran.Program.Bounded` stays
Fable-clean with no gate. A new sink interface, a hash function of this repository's own, or a
`System.Security.Cryptography` reference were each the nearer thing to write and each a second
spelling of a seam that exists.

**Two smaller choices, recorded because each will be re-proposed.** The signed record carries the
demanded document's bytes VERBATIM as a string beside the signature, rather than splicing it in as a
nested object: the wire is unchanged, a consumer that ignores the signature hands `Envelope` to
`Demanded.decode` and reads what it read before, and the bytes the signature covers are the bytes in
the record with nothing re-rendered between. And drift is decided on DOCUMENTS rather than bytes: a
re-serialised copy that still says the same thing is the same document, and the signature — which is
over the recomputed bytes regardless — decides whether the pair was signed.

**What this forecloses, deliberately.** No trust decision about the KEY is made here. Whether the
offered key is one to believe — its lifecycle, its revocation, whose it is — is the host's key
directory's question, answered before the key is handed to `verify`; this repository checks a
signature under a key it was given, and nothing more. And the operator command that runs the check
lives with the tooling that has a tree and a key directory in hand, not here: this repository
delivers the two library functions it calls.

## D16 — The operator's controls are RECORDED OPS on a session stream, not imperative calls; a machine raiser and a person raise the same op (2026-09-19)

Suspend, throttle, revoke and resume are the three acts an operator reaches for first and the fourth
that undoes one of them. `InteractionBudget` refuses one costly interaction and D12's journal records
the one arm that reaches outside; neither can halt a session that is already running, slow one effect
kind, or withdraw a performer while a handler is live. This decision is how those four acts are
carried, and four things about it are decisions rather than implementation detail.

**The act is a record, and the state is a FOLD of it.** `Controls.fold` is a total function of the
entry list and of nothing else, so the state a resume reaches is the state any reader of the same
prefix reaches. The alternative — a flag on a session object, set by a method — was refused for the
reason D1 refuses a richer evaluator, read one level up: an imperative control cannot be replayed, so
a resumed session does not know it was ever stopped; it cannot be audited, so "what did the AI do"
omits the part where somebody stopped it; and it cannot be shown monotone, because there is no record
to be monotone over. Recording the act buys all three from one mechanism, and the cost is one port
and one fold. The consequence is that a control takes effect at the NEXT consultation and never
mid-effect: there is no way to express "stop this call", only "perform no more", which is what a
bounded, staged handler can actually honour.

**A machine-raised suspend and an operator-raised one are the SAME OP.** The raiser is a
`ControlActor` on the entry — `operator` or `machine` — and no rule below the record reads it. Two
op families would have meant two fold rules, two audit vocabularies, and two places for a fifth
control to be added to only one of; and the automated raiser is not a lesser authority, it is the
same authority with a different hand on it. So an automated detector that suspends a session (the
denial-pattern case) produces an entry indistinguishable to the fold from an operator's, and
distinguishable to an auditor, which is the only reader that should care.

**Each act is expressed in a vocabulary that already exists.** A suspend closes the session's own G1
dispatch gate, so a suspended step is refused through the same path and with the same
`ServerReject.Gate` shape as any other policy refusal; a throttle closes the effect gate over one
capability, so a breach is the ordinary structured `GateRefused` denial — which HALTS the handler in
the plan phase, and because every host call is staged to the perform phase (D8), a breach therefore
performs **none** of that handler's calls rather than some of them; and a revocation REMOVES the
performer, so it reads as `Unregistered` — the arm that says "the capability is absent from this
host" — which carries the withdrawal through `ServerCoverage` to the demanded-effect check with
nothing new to teach it. A new denial arm per control would have been the obvious design and would
have left every existing consumer of the two-arm distinction unable to see any of them.

**A `Resume` lifts the suspend and NOTHING else, and a revocation is never lifted at all.** The
monotonicity is a property of six lines — no arm of `Controls.step` removes a key from `Revoked` — and
not a promise about a lifetime, which is what makes it checkable over every prefix of a stream rather
than assertable in prose. Re-registering a withdrawn performer is a host act on a fresh session, and
that ceremony is the point. A resume that also cleared throttles and revocations would read as tidier
and would make the mildest word in the vocabulary the most consequential one.

**What this forecloses.** A throttle window is COUNTED, never timed: it is a per-invocation budget of
attempts, because a rate over wall-clock time folds to a different answer on every re-read and the
whole value of recording these acts is that it does not. A host that wants a time-based rate limit
owns that above this placement, where a clock is legitimate. The control stream is also keyed by
SESSION rather than by invocation, and is a second port beside `EffectJournal` rather than a field
added to it — the shapes agree, the keys do not, and filing a suspend under one invocation id would
make it invisible to the next one.

And the wire form is **deliberately a host document, not a specified one.** The program wire
specifies what a handler declares, what it may reach and what it reports; the control stream is what
a host's operator did to a session. Specifying it now would pin an encoding before a second host had
ever read one — the same posture the demanded-effect projection takes, for the same reason. It
round-trips canonically here so the acts are portable between this host's own stores in the meantime,
and a fifth control arm is refused at decode rather than admitted, so the closure is enforced and not
merely intended.

## D17 — The gate decides on ARGUMENTS as well as on the capability name; the policy is declared DATA, carried in the envelope, and refused through the vocabulary that already exists (2026-09-19)

**Decision.** A host declares an argument policy beside an effect registration — a closed set of
three clauses: an **allow-list** over one named argument, a **ceiling** on the declarative payload's
canonical bytes, and a **label** that is carried and decides nothing. `Handler.runEffect` checks the
effect's actual arguments against the clauses declared for its capability in the gate's own
position: after the capability is admitted by name, and still before a pipeline is evaluated, an op
reaches the apply engine, or a performer is looked up. A capability nobody constrained is
UNCONSTRAINED. The declared policy is joined onto the demanded document
(`ServerDemanded.ofTreeHandlersAndRegistry`) and is part of what `verifyWithRegistry` recomputes.

**Why the gate was not enough.** It decides about a NAME derived from the effect's own
discriminator, which is the whole decision for an effect whose arguments a host authored and not the
whole decision for one whose arguments carry a value that came off the wire. "`HostCall` allowed" is
not "`HostCall` to `api.example.com` allowed", and a permitted capability reaching an endpoint nobody
permitted is the confused deputy the escape-hatch inventory records as the residual on the host-call
hatch. The two halves compose in one direction only: a bound can narrow a capability the gate
admitted and can never widen one it refused, and a capability refused by name never has its arguments
examined at all.

**Why DATA rather than a second predicate.** `Gate` is a closure: it can be asked and it cannot be
read. A bound written down can be read back, carried in the demanded document, and put in front of a
deployer before anything runs — which is the difference between a record that says "HTTP" and one
that says "HTTP to api.example.com, ≤ 64 KB". It is also what makes the bound VERIFIABLE rather than
merely attestable: because the policy is recomputed from the registry, a host that has since widened
an allow-list, raised a ceiling or dropped a clause presents as drift. Signing the demand without the
policy would have left a verifier able to read what a host once claimed and unable to tell whether it
still held.

**Why the refusal reuses `Failed(capability, reason)` and adds NO denial arm.** The denial DU is
wire-specified — `Unregistered` and `GateRefused` are a closed `oneOf` in the program wire's outcome
schema — and neither is true here: the capability exists and the gate admitted it. A third arm would
have been a five-artefact change across two repositories (normative text, schemas, resident emitter,
manifest, host codec) to say something the existing halt already says exactly: the landing-slot
refusal beside it is the same class of check — a declarative bound on a declared argument, applied
while planning — and reports the same way. The `reason` member is an unconstrained string in the
schema, so `argument-not-allowed:<argument>` and `payload-over-ceiling:<limit>` are conformant bytes
on the day they ship.

**What a refusal may say.** The host's own DECLARATION and nothing measured from the payload: the
argument the host constrained, never the value found there, and the host's limit, never the size that
met it. A measured size is not the payload, but it is a fact about it, and an argument check is the
one place in this placement that reads a wire-supplied string — the seam to hold that line at, not the
one to concede it at.

**The document version moved to 4**, on the argument versions 2 and 3 already made rather than by
analogy to it. `constraints` is present on EVERY server tier from here on, `[]` where nothing was
constrained, so an ABSENT key says "this producer predates the policy" and an EMPTY one says "this was
read and nothing bounds these capabilities". For this member the collapse is not merely lossy: it
turns "I cannot see the bounds" into "there are none", which is the opposite of the safe reading.

**Two limits, stated rather than assumed.** A host call's arguments are read ONE LEVEL DEEP and
string-valued only, so a host whose performer reads a nested member cannot express an allow-list over
it — the bound belongs on the top-level argument the performer takes, or the performer belongs behind
a narrower registration. And a ceiling bounds a DECLARATIVE payload — a host call's arguments, a
notification's payload — never an op sequence: those are not a `JVal` at that point in compile order,
and a ceiling that silently meant one thing for three arms and another for two would be worse than one
that names the two it does not cover.

**An allow-list an effect names nothing under is VACUOUSLY satisfied**, and that is the correct
reading rather than a lenient one: a bound says what may be reached under that name, and an effect
naming nothing there reaches nothing there. A host wanting the argument to be mandatory is asking for
a clause it did not declare.

## D18 — The generic tier is cut now, as a decision; the core is parameterised by a witness whose centre is an ACTION VIEW; the UI binding becomes an adapter (2026-09-27)

**2026-09-27. Amends D4 (the timing clause) and D5 (the direction clause). Both entries stand
otherwise.** The evidence is in [`docs/generic-tier.md`](docs/generic-tier.md): the per-member
inventory, the contract written out as types, the two adapter homes, and the consumer measurement.
This entry records only what binds.

**The cut is taken without waiting for its trigger.** D4 said the generic tier would wait for a
second domain to instantiate the algebra. That has not happened. The dependency is being cut anyway,
because this domain and the UI tier are separate sovereignties, and D4's own opening paragraph
already made them so "from birth". A trigger that has not fired does not make the coupling right; it
only makes it cheaper to leave in place. D4's warning still holds: an abstraction with one witness
bakes that witness's assumptions in. The answer is not to wait. It is to **name every assumption the
contract keeps, with the evidence that would falsify it** (K1–K8 in the note), so none of them ends
up in the contract without a record.

**The contract.** `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`, `.Runtime` and `.Server` are parameterised by one record
of functions, `ProgramWitness`, in the style Core already uses for `NodeWitness` and `StreamWitness`.
It has six parts:

1. **tree**: Core's `NodeWitness<'Node, string>`, reused unchanged, plus per-node handlers,
   re-resolution, cost, query readers, binding uses, and a canonical encoding.
2. **action**: a total `View` onto four shapes: `Sequence`, `Assign`, `Call`, and `Leaf`.
3. **expression**: resolution against the store, with three outcomes.
4. **store**: assign a state key, land a query result, and a reserved-namespace predicate.
5. **op**: Core's `StreamWitness<'Op, 'Node, _>`, reused unchanged, plus `Diff` and `AbsoluteTarget`.
6. **effect and claim**: the effect's kind, destination and codec, and a claim verifier that is
   generic in the key.

Nothing is added to `Fuaran.Core.*`. Each of the three things Core lacks (a state store, expression
resolution, a claim verifier) has exactly one witness today. Promoting any of them into Core would
repeat D4's error one layer down.

**The fold interprets the view, and only the view.** It owns sequencing, the one store write, the
reserved-namespace refusal, D9's refusal of a declared result target, and D7's handler-effect arm. It
never recurses into a `Leaf`. A leaf lowers to **at most one** effect, or is refused, or is declined,
and it **never writes the store**. That is D1 exactly: control structure is the evaluator's, and
vocabulary lowers to it. Those constraints also keep `run_total`'s "at most one effect, at most one
key" true as stated. The budget, the demanded projection and the replay classification move from wire
tags onto the view, which removes their string coupling to `"Call"`, `"Chain"` and `"SetState"`. The
UI's fourteen-case totality check, together with its `#nowarn "44"` scope, moves into the adapter's
`View`, where the compiler still checks it.

**D14 applies to the new part.** The cut re-types an evaluator that already exists, so the model that
has to come first is the model of the view. Phase 1896 re-states `BoundedFold.fst` over the four view
shapes and re-proves totality, no-closure-invocation and the `Chain` homomorphism **before** it ports
`BoundedActions.fs`. No-closure-invocation becomes an obligation on the witness: the core holds no
closures, so only a witness's `View` or `Lower` could reach one. The differential oracle runs through
the UI adapter.

**D5's direction clause is resolved: no core package references `Fuaran.UI.*`, and a test enforces
that.** The three core packages take direct `Fuaran.Core.*` references in its place. They currently
reach `Fuaran.Core.Wire`, `.Column`, `.DataFrame` and `.OpStream` only transitively, through the UI
packages. The remainder of D5 holds unchanged: **no `Fuaran.UI.*` package references
`Fuaran.Program.*`.** An application in the UI tier that consumes this domain is a consumer, not a
package, and D5 never ruled that out.

**The adapter's home — A, ratified by the operator on 2026-09-27.** The adapter is two packages, split
along the core's own Fable/.NET line. One is Fable-clean and holds the UI witness plus the UI
transport loop (event validation, `DomPatch` lowering, the live connection, the client runtime). The
other is .NET-only and holds the server placement's UI event step. There are two candidate homes:

- **A, this repository** (`Fuaran.Program.UI`, `Fuaran.Program.Server.UI`). This keeps D5's direction.
  It releases core and adapter as one version in one commit. The existing suite and the scenario
  corpus stay here, run by project reference, so no skew is possible.
- **B, the UI tier** (an adapter package there that references this repository's core). This
  repository then names no UI package at all. But it reverses the surviving half of D5, ties the UI
  tier's lockstep releases to this domain's cadence, and forces the UI-typed half of this
  repository's suite and the client-effect family's certification to move out of the repository
  that owns the behaviour. Keeping them here beside a UI-tier adapter would compile the core twice,
  which is D5's skew class.

**Recommended, and ratified: A.** It is the smaller correct change, and moving later from A to B moves two leaf
packages, while moving from B back to A would move tests and a certified wire family. The
recommendation flips to B if "separate" means this repository names no UI package *at all*, rather
than only that its core does not. That was the operator's judgement; the operator ratified A on
2026-09-27 (the core must not reference UI; two leaf adapter packages here may). **Phase 1896 does not depend on the choice.** It needs only a test
witness. Phase 1897 builds the adapter wherever this clause lands.

**Consequences.**

- **Version.** All packages move to `0.6.0`, a pre-1.0 minor. It is breaking for the three core
  packages, whose public types gain type parameters. The adapter packages are new, and core and
  adapter release together. The adapter re-exposes today's names as closed aliases and partially
  applied modules, so for most consumers migration means changing one reference and one `open`.
- **Migration set.** It was measured across the consumers, not taken from the plan, and it is
  **five, not three**:
  - a composition consumer's effect-envelope verifier and its generated-application template
    (`Bounded`, and `Server` for the template). Its verifier opens UI namespaces it never declares,
    and this contract lets that verifier go UI-free, since the claim verifier is generic in the key
    and the tree walk arrives as a witness. Its composition root then declares the adapter;
  - the out-of-repository evaluation suite (D11) (`Bounded`, `Server`). It opens no UI namespace and
    needs the server adapter only because its corpus is UI trees;
  - a downstream application with a server placement (`Bounded`, `Server`). It raises as its own act;
  - two applications in the UI tier (`Runtime`; `Bounded` and `Runtime`).

  The consumers' current pins already disagree (`0.1.0-alpha.1`, `0.4.0`, `0.5.0`). Raising each one
  is that consumer's own act.
- **The program wire specification does not change.** No schema, fixture byte or rule changes. Its
  §3 already treats the action and tree-op algebras as referenced vocabularies "specified elsewhere",
  spliced byte-stably by their own canonical encoders. The envelopes around them are this domain's own
  and are UI-free today. The UI witness fills each referenced position with the same encoder as today.
  The evidence is the codec families passing byte-identically through the core and the adapter, and
  the twelve driver scenarios passing through the adapter's loop. **Any difference in a fixture byte
  falsifies this clause**, and it means the refactor changed behaviour, not only where the types
  live.

## D19 — The second witness's findings land IN Program: a halting guard in the view, an op's reach on the op witness, a registered op performer in the perform phase, and the op channel's rejection stays `string` (2026-10-01)

**2026-10-01. Phase 1967. Amends K2 of `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.7 and the D8 reading of which arm
is staged; D4's standing note records the instantiation this answers.**

The first second-domain instantiation of the generic tier — a handler that is a VERB, with store
reads, file writes and deletes, a commit and a push as the `'Op` of `ApplyOps` — ran under the
unmodified 0.6.0 `Handler.run` and was correct, and built three things beside Program to be so: its
own walk over its ops to say what the handler reaches, guards that rode the op channel as apply
errors so a refusal could halt, and a two-phase discipline of its own so a refused plan performed
nothing. Each is the drift D4 warned about, pointed the other way: a second demanded projection and
policy growing in parallel to Program's. This entry moves all three into Program, and records the
one thing it leaves as it was.

**1. The halting refusal is a shape of the view, `Require of condition: 'Expr` — option (a).**
Halting is control structure: "nothing after this runs" is a statement about the sequence, and D1
puts control structure in the evaluator and vocabulary beneath it. A handler-stage guard (option b)
would have halted too, but at the placement rather than in the algebra — a browser placement would
have had no guard at all — and it would have been a THIRD stage kind, which the program wire
specification's §4.2 closes at two and whose widening is a specification act across five artefacts.
A view shape is the action algebra's, which the specification references and does not spell; no
wire moves. The guard's condition resolves through `ExprWitness.Resolve` exactly as an `Assign`'s
`from` does: the boolean `true` holds, any other value, an unresolved condition and an errored one
halt, and an errored one's text is the halt's reason verbatim — so a domain's typed refusal reaches
the diagnostic through the arrow the contract already had. **A guard reads the state channel** (K4):
what a guard needs to see is where a verb's arguments and read results land, and a domain that keeps
its model in the tree exposes what its guards read through the channel. The fold's outcome says
`Halted`; the fold does not roll back — the store is the store as of the halt, and the placement that
rolls back is the handler, whose atomicity unit it is (D8). A leaf's `Refuse` keeps its non-halting
behaviour; nothing at the UI witness views as a guard, and `ui_never_halts` proves the UI tier
unchanged. K2 now reads: control structure is sequence + assign + call + require, and everything else
is a leaf. **D14 applied: `BoundedFold.fst` was restated over five shapes and re-proved before the
port** — the sequence homomorphism is the one law the shape changes, gaining a halting clause that is
vacuous for every view without a guard.

**2. An op's reach is a member of the op witness, `Reach: 'Op -> OpReach`, read by the argument
policy and the demanded projection.** `OpReach` is the op's named arguments — the `(argument, value)`
pairs `ServerArgumentPolicy.arguments` already returned for a host call — and its destination class
in the client effects' own `EffectDestination` vocabulary (W4: the reach-describing member sat on the
wrong channel; it now sits on both). `ServerArgumentPolicy.arguments` reads it for `ApplyOps` and
`EmitPatch`, so an `AllowList` on either arm binds, and the destination class is allow-listed under
the reserved `destination` argument, so a policy can bound WHERE an op may reach without knowing how
a domain names it. `payloadBytes` measures an op sequence as its ops' canonical bytes, so a `Ceiling`
binds too. The demanded document carries the reach as a server-tier member at **version 5** —
present and empty where the ops name nothing, on the argument versions 2, 3 and 4 each made — and
`ServerDemanded.ofEffect` reads it through the policy's own extraction, so the document and the
enforcement are one enumeration. The reach is DESCRIPTIVE, like the replay posture and the declared
policy: no coverage finding is computed from it; the argument policy is the enforcement. The UI
witness's reach is the nodes a tree op addresses, under the op's own member names, and deliberately
not every string member: a prop path, a binding slot and a prop value are what an op writes, and a
reach the document carries must never be a payload. A consequence stated rather than discovered: a
signed envelope is verified by recomputation, so every envelope signed under version 4 reports
`Unreadable` drift under this reader, naming the version — the honest refusal — and is re-signed.

**3. Program performs an op through a REGISTERED op performer, in the perform phase — the hook, not
the stated plan-only contract.** `OpPerformance<'Op>` is `InMemory` — the apply is the effect, the UI
tier's placement and every placement's default — or `Performed of ('Op -> Result<unit, string>)`.
Under a performer `ApplyOps` is a staged arm: its ops are applied in memory while planning, as always,
so a later stage reads the planned tree, and each op is staged as a call of its own — the registered
performer closed over the op, in the shape a staged host call carries — and performed after the plan
commits, in plan order beside the host calls. D8's law then covers ops with no new vocabulary:
`Performed` names `ApplyOps` once per op PERFORMED in execution order, a part-way failure is a
`PerformFailed` under that capability with the prefix that ran reported, and `Staging.fst` proves it
over the same staged list, its `plan_pure` gaining the one clause that matters — the plan phase reads
only whether a performer is registered and what it stages, never what it answers. The hook was
chosen over the documented plan-only contract because the contract would have widened `PerformFailed`
to describe a host-performed plan, which is an outcome-wire vocabulary change the specification
spells, while the hook changes no wire at all; and because that domain's placement had already written
the hook once, beside Program, which is the measure of where it belongs. The one specification
sentence a registered performer reads past — §6.2's "only `HostCall` is staged" — describes the
in-memory placement, which every conformant host had and every UI host still has; carrying the
performer case into the normative text is a specification act and is not taken here. The durable
interpreter (D12) runs in memory and journals no performed op; a verb under the durable tier is
stated as not covered rather than half-covered. `Handler.run` keeps its signature as `runWith` at
`InMemory`; `ServerServices` carries the performance and the session's arm passes it.

**4. The op channel's rejection stays `string` (W5).** A seventh type parameter for the rejection
would reach every public type that names the witness, the handler's halt vocabulary, the outcome wire
— where a reason is a string by specification — and the journal, to carry a type that crosses a
process boundary as text in every one of those places anyway. What a typed refusal does instead is
what the first second witness did: render it canonically (`Canon.render` over its own JSON) into the
string the op channel or the guard's `Errored` carries, and parse it back on the far side. The
in-repo second witness pins that crossing (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Tests/VerbWitnessTests.fs`, W5).

**What this forecloses.** A guard that recurses — a conditional with two non-refusal arms — is still
a new view case plus a model change under D14, never a leaf that threads the store (K2's falsifier
stands). An op performer is trusted on the terms a host function is; the gate and the policy decide
what reaches it, and nothing here says what it does when invoked. A reach that could carry a payload
is a witness defect, not a vocabulary one.

**The regression test is the second witness itself.** The first second witness's differential and adversaries
are the test for whether its parallel machinery can now be deleted; re-running it against 0.7.0 is
that domain's act. The in-repo second witness — a verb over an in-memory file map, with an adversary
per finding — is this repository's own, and runs in the ordinary gate.

## D20 — The contract is cut THREE ways: a required state axis, an optional walk axis, an optional dispatch axis; the guard and the performer move onto the state (2026-10-01)

**2026-10-01. Phase 1974. Supersedes D18's single `ProgramWitness` record and amends D19 decisions 1
and 3; rereads K4 of `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.7.**

Three witnesses have now measured the contract: the UI tier, which fills every member; a verb
(D19), which filled six of thirty-one meaningfully; and a document pipeline under a server placement
— a domain whose state is its tree — which filled fourteen of thirty-two. The members vacuous for
both non-UI witnesses are the same set. This entry cuts the contract along it.

**1. Three records, composed; the composition's type says which are filled.** `StateWitness<'Node,
'Op>` is REQUIRED — `Stream`, `Reach`, `AbsoluteTarget`, `Canonical`, `Diff`, `View`: the state the
ops apply to, what an op reaches, its canonical form, how a refusal crosses (D19 decision 4,
unchanged), and which ops are guards. `WalkWitness<'Node>` is OPTIONAL — `Nodes`, `Traverse`,
`Cost`, `QueryReaders`: the read-only walks, independent of dispatch, which is why it is an axis and
not half of the next one. `DispatchWitness<'Node, 'Action, 'Expr, 'Store, 'Effect>` is OPTIONAL —
`Handlers`, `Events`, `Resolve` and the `Action`, `Expr`, `Store` and `Effect` sub-records: what an
event-driven fold over a tree needs, so a domain that fills it is saying it has events.
`ProgramWitness<'Node, 'Op, 'Walk, 'Dispatch>` composes them, an unfilled position holding
`Unfilled`. A core path names the axes it reads in its signature, so a path that reads an axis a
composition does not fill is a COMPILE error, never a runtime default standing in for a member nobody
wrote. The paths that must run under every composition — the fold, the server handler, the server
demanded projection — read the dispatch position through `IDispatchPosition`, which `Unfilled`
answers at action and effect types that have no values (`Nothing`) and a `unit` store: a handler
there cannot hold a compute stage, because there is nothing to put in one, and a landing slot has no
binding channel to land in, so it is refused while planning (`no-binding-channel`).

**2. Why the two-axis proposal was wrong, on two data points.** The verb suggested "tree optional,
ops required" because the verb had no tree. The document has a tree and fills six of its eleven tree
members faithfully — and nothing on its path reads them to any effect but the walk and the hash: no
handler is reached from a document node, nothing budgets one by its handlers, nothing re-resolves one
from a store. (a) That cut would have had the document fill a whole axis for nothing, because the
members it lacks — handlers, events, the action view, the store, the effects — are not the tree; they
are DISPATCH. (b) It would have left both capabilities the document actually lacked where they were:
the guard, which resolved against the store and could not see the tree, and the performer, which was
handed the op and never the state. Both are about the STATE, and the cut that puts them there is the
one that names a state axis.

**3. The guard moves onto the state: `OpView.Require` (F-GUARD; amends D19 decision 1).** D19 put the
halting refusal in the action view and had it read the state channel, saying a domain that keeps its
model in the tree exposes what its guards read through the channel. The document showed what that
costs: nothing moves the planned tree into the store, so a handler that planned a banned edit and then
required the pack committed and published it, while the same check as an op refused it. The op
channel now has a guard shape: an op the state witness views as `Require` is resolved through the
op's own apply against the state AS OF ITS POSITION IN THE PLAN — `Ok` holds and the state does not
move (the answer is discarded, so a guard cannot write), `Error reason` halts with `reason` verbatim as
the `ApplyOps` arm's existing `Failed`, the same W5 crossing — and it is never staged and never
performed. Its demanded-projection contribution is its reach under `ApplyOps`, as an edit's is, so
the argument policy binds a guard on the same terms. The fold's `Require` stays: it is the right guard
for a domain whose guards are over the binding store. No view shape, stage kind, effect arm or
diagnostic was added. `guard_holds_moves_nothing` and `guard_refusal_halts` in `Staging.fst`.

**4. The performer is handed the state (F-PERFORM; amends D19 decision 3).**
`OpPerformance.Performed` is `'Node -> 'Op -> Result<unit, string>`: each edit is staged with the
planned state with that edit applied. For a verb whose op is the act this is unused; for a tail that
persists what the plan produced — render the document, commit the ops — it is the difference between
being handed the plan and folding the ops again from the entry state in the trusted base, which is
the plan phase run twice, once inside Program and once outside it. `Performed`, the `PerformFailed`
prefix report and the two-phase discipline are unchanged; `performer_handed_the_plan` proves the last
edit's state is the plan's final state, and `plan_pure` still holds because the plan reads only what
the registered performer STAGES.

**5. K4 is a dispatch-axis fact.** One mutable state channel beside the tree is what an event-driven
fold writes; the verb has no such channel and the document keeps its bound values inside itself. The
channel lives on the dispatch axis and nowhere else.

**What a fourth domain reads, per axis.**

- **State — always.** Six members, every one meaningful for any domain with ops: apply / encode /
  decode, reach, absolute target (replay), canonical form (the signed envelope's hash), diff (the
  session loop's; an empty diff is legal and stated), and which ops are guards (`OpView.edits` if
  none). Obligations: the apply is total and pure; the encoder is canonical (K6); a typed refusal
  renders canonically into the reason and parses back (W5); a reach value is a name the op reaches,
  never what it writes (D19).
- **Walk — if the state is a tree you want priced, walked or projected.** Obligations: `Children` and
  `ReplaceChildren` invert each other; ids have a faithful string form (K1); `Cost` is the node's own
  data cost, and the saturating arithmetic is the core's.
- **Dispatch — only if nodes carry handlers that events dispatch.** Obligations: the view unfolds a
  finite tree and its laws are the fold's (K2, K3, K5, K8); a leaf writes no store; the reserved
  namespace is the witness's predicate. A domain without events fills `Unfilled`: its reads and
  guards are ops, and its tail is a performer handed the plan.

**D14 applied a third time:** `proofs/README.md` gained "The three axes" — each theorem's members and
so the axes it needs — before a `.fs` file moved; `Staging.fst` restated its `ApplyOps` arm as one
fold and gained the three theorems above, every earlier statement unchanged; `EffectGate.fst`
followed.

**What this forecloses.** A member added to the contract names its axis, and a new core path names
the axes it reads; a path that reads dispatch "if present" is the defect this entry removes. A guard
that must thread a store through sub-actions is still a view shape and a model change under D14 (K2's
falsifier stands), on the dispatch axis.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking,
and a draft moves only for a change of a higher class (`STABILITY.md`). No wire member moved
(`docs/generic-tier.md` §6). The in-repo witnesses are the regression test: the UI adapter
byte-identical through the parity suite, the verb filling the state axis only, and a document
pipeline filling state and walk, with the third instantiation's two guard tests inverted and its
performer's re-fold removed (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Tests/`).

## D21 — The core algebra gains selection and bounded iteration on BOTH axes, designed for reversal; the reversible fragment is decided from the tree and undone by trace (2026-10-01)

**2026-10-01. Phase 1976. Fulfils D1 and D2; takes the route D19 named for a conditional ("a new
view case … under D14"), for selection and bounded iteration together; amends K2 of
`docs/generic-tier.md` §3.7 a second time; leaves B2 (`OpReach.Destination`) single-valued, with the
reason below.**

D1 fixes the core as sequencing + typed branching + named effects and D2 permits bounded iteration,
yet the generic tier's view had sequence, a store write, a call, a halting guard and the domain's
leaves — one structured-programming construct, plus abort. It went unnoticed because the only
witness was the UI tier, which branches in the TREE and repeats through data binding. The second
witness's re-run — a domain whose handler is a store-mutating verb — met the gap at its first verb
with an arm that does not refuse, and had to carry its own two-arm construct beside Program: the
parallel-machinery drift D19 existed to remove. This entry closes it, under D14 (the model first,
`proofs/BoundedFold.fst` and `proofs/Staging.fst` restated and re-proved before a `.fs` moved), and
records what the model argued for.

**1. Two shapes, on both axes, MIRRORED rather than shared.** `ActionView` gains `Choose(entry,
whenTrue, whenFalse, exit)` and `Repeat(bound, body)`; `OpView<'Op>` gains `Choose(entry, whenTrue,
whenFalse, exit)` over ops and `Repeat(count, body)`. The phase's default was the op axis alone, so
a state-only domain reaches them; the model argued for both, because the second witness's branch is
over OPS while the reversal theorem the phase charters is about the STORE the dispatch fold writes
(`Assign` is the one destructive step, and the one that needs a trace). One shared definition was
considered and rejected: the condition channel differs per axis — an expression resolved against the
binding store to a value, versus a guard op applied for its answer — and the state axis has no value
channel a parameter bound could be read from, so a shared shape would offer a case one axis must
refuse. D20 set the precedent with two guards, one per axis, "the guards of two different states";
the two selections and the two repeats are the same thing. D1's "one core algebra" is kept where it
matters: one evaluator per axis, one law set, and `repeat_is_unrolling` / `repeat_plans_as_unrolling`
tie each repeat to the sequence of its body so no sequence law is restated.

**2. Conditions, and the exit assertion.** On the dispatch axis the entry condition resolves exactly
as a guard's: the boolean `true` takes the true arm, any other value the false arm, and an unresolved
or errored condition HALTS before either arm (a branch that cannot decide is a defect, not a default;
the phase's "argue against halting" was argued and lost — the alternative, a default arm, silently
turns a resolver fault into a chosen branch). On the op axis the channel has two answers and no
third: `Ok` is true, `Error` is false, so a domain's typed refusal is the false value and never a halt
— the shape the verb's "already migrated / not yet" arms want, and the one a guard's protocol already
reads. The EXIT assertion (Janus; Lutz and Yokoyama) is optional, resolves against the store the arm
left, and must hold after the true arm and fail after the false arm; violated, unresolved or errored
it halts AFTER the arm with the assertion named in the reason — the arm's writes and effects stand as
of the halt, the handler rolls back (D8). Forwards it costs a program nothing to omit; omitted, the
branch is outside the reversible fragment, because nothing then says which arm to undo.

**3. The bound, and no index.** On the dispatch axis `Bound<'Expr>` is a literal count or a
parameter resolved ONCE at entry to a `JInt` and checked against `[lo, hi]`, outside which the repeat
halts before its first iteration — the over-bound refusal — so the budget can price it at `hi`
without the store. On the op axis the count is a literal the view produces: D2's range check is the
domain's, at its codec, and a deployer's ceiling is the argument policy's, through a `count` argument
on the repeat's reach (the verb witness does exactly this, and an off-list count is refused before
anything performs). The body sees no index: its one channel to state is the store it writes, and an
index it could overwrite would not be a function of the bound alone, which running the inverse the
same number of times rests on. A negative count is refused on both axes — the one guard the model,
whose count is a `nat`, cannot express, so it is the code's and is said to be.

**4. The budget.** A branch is priced at one step (its condition) plus the MORE EXPENSIVE arm; a
repeat at one step (its bound) plus its body times the bound, a parameter bound at the top of its
range. `fold_steps_within_cost` proves a run never takes more steps than this prices, so the price
computed from the tree before the run bounds the work the run does — "safe to run untrusted" extended
to the two shapes.

**5. The demanded union, the policy, and B2.** A branch demands the union of its entry, BOTH arms
and its exit; a repeat its bound and its body once. `OpView.beneath` enumerates the ops under a flow
op, and `ServerArgumentPolicy.reachOfOp` reads an op's reach over itself and those, so an untaken
arm's reach is still reach and a sequence that reaches an off-list path in either arm is refused.
B2 — whether `OpReach.Destination` becomes a set because a branch's arms may reach two destinations
— is answered NO: a branch reaches nothing of its own, each op beneath it names one destination, and
the policy reads them one by one; a set on the branch would be a second enumeration of what the arms
already say. The verb's `Branch` reaches `OpReach.nothing`.

**6. Reversibility, designed in; `Assign` by trace.** The reversible fragment is SYNTACTIC —
`reversible` reads the tree and nothing else: sequence, assign, the guard (its own inverse), a branch
WITH an exit assertion, a repeat with a LITERAL bound; never a call or a leaf (effects are a property
of the op and a later phase's). `Assign` destroys the old value, so it joins the fragment BY TRACE
rather than by construction (the Bennett embedding): a reversible run records, at each write, the
value it overwrote, and the inverse restores it with an ordinary assignment. This is the one place
trace is preferred over construction, and the reason is that the alternative — a reversible
assignment, `x += e` — is a different store algebra than K4's keyed channel, which every witness
already fills. WHERE the trace lives: beside the outcome of `BoundedActions.runTraced`, which the
plan phase holds exactly as it holds the pre-state; the forward `run` records nothing and reads
nothing, because the two are ONE fold with a tracing flag (D1's one evaluating `match` is kept; the
model has `fold` and `fold_traced` and proves them equal in outcome). WHAT it costs the contract:
`StoreWitness.Read`, the one new member, called by the reversible run alone, with K4's
read-after-write law as the witness's obligation. WHAT it refuses: a key that was absent before the
run cannot be restored by an assignment (the store has no delete), so the trace says so and
`Trace.restorable` refuses the inverse rather than building it wrong — `reverse_run` is conditional
on it, and named as such in the ladder. The inverse of a run is a program the core folds through the
same evaluator (`Reversed`, `runReversed`): a sequence inverts to its members' inverses in reverse
order; a branch to the branch whose entry is the exit assertion and whose exit is the entry
condition, the arm that ran inverted and the other EMPTY (nothing was recorded for it, and the exit
assertion is what guarantees the inverse never takes it); a repeat to the SEQUENCE of its
iterations' inverses, because each iteration overwrote different values.

**7. What halts.** Three shapes now halt — a guard, a branch (an undecided condition, a violated
exit assertion), a repeat (an unreadable or over-bound count) — so Phase 1967's "only a guard halts"
is false over the widened view. `fold_no_halting_shape_no_halt` is the general statement and
`fold_no_require_no_halt` keeps its name as the corollary for a view without the new shapes, which
is every view the UI witness produces (`ui_view_no_flow`, proved; tested over the arm-complete
corpus) — so every UI theorem keeps its unconditional form and the UI tier is byte-identical through
the parity suite and the Fable leg.

**8. D14 applied a fourth time, and two findings for the next restatement.** The op view in
`Staging.fst` is now taken to exhaustion, as the action view has been since Phase 1898, so planning
terminates structurally and the finite-unfolding obligation sits on the witness's `View`. Two things
the restatement found about the prover, recorded so they are not re-found: inside a RECURSIVE lemma,
an application with many implicit type arguments (`plan_view w cap stage x tree staged`) does not get
its result's inversion — a `match` on it fails as "patterns are incomplete" — and a let-binding with
an explicit type repairs it; and an extractable definition keeps its tuple patterns (`ROk (tree',
staged')`) because `fst`/`snd` would extract to a runtime name the `Prims` shim deliberately does not
carry, while the lemma bodies that reason about it project with `fst`/`snd`.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking,
and this is breaking of the same class — every exhaustive match over `ActionView` or `OpView`,
`OpView` becoming `OpView<'Op>`, `StoreWitness` gaining `Read`. No wire member moved (`docs/
generic-tier.md` §6); the demanded document stays at version 5, carrying both arms' reach only when
a program uses a branch. `STABILITY.md` has the consumer's account and `docs/migrations/phase-1976.md`
the diff.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** Whether an OP can be undone is a property of the op,
declared on the state witness by the phase that owns the undo posture; this entry gives the flow
algebra its inverse and nothing else. An op-axis parameter bound would be a value channel on the
state axis — a D20-class change, not a view case. The UI adapter adopts neither shape; a UI handler
that would genuinely benefit lands as a finding against `ui_view_no_flow`'s test, never as an
adoption here.


## D22 — The undo posture: a handler is classed reversible, compensable or one-way from its declared form before it runs, every edit's inverse is computed from the pre-state the plan holds, and the undo is a handler run through the same gate and performers (2026-10-01)

**2026-10-01. Phase 1977. Follows D21: 1976 gave the flow algebra its inverse and left whether an
OP can be undone "a property of the op, declared on the state witness by the phase that owns the
undo posture". This is that phase. Adds the seventh member of `StateWitness`, the trail a run
leaves for its undo, the classifier and the undo run; moves the demanded document to version 6;
adds K9 to `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.7.**

Program already answers one question of this shape before a handler runs: `Replay.fs` classes
each handler `safe | unsafe | unknown` from its declared form, and the demanded document carries
it, so a host decides whether a session may be RESUMED without running anything. The other
question a deployer asks of a verb that writes files and pushes a branch is "if it runs, can it be
undone — and up to where?", and nothing answered it: an undo was a rollback someone wrote by hand
against each domain's store, or nothing. This entry answers it on the replay posture's terms —
read before the run, carried in the document, enforced at the placement — and records what the
model (`proofs/Undo.fst`, D14 applied a fifth time: restated and proved before a `.fs` moved)
argued for.

**1. The member, and the shape the model argued for.** The phase's shape to argue against was
`Undo: 'Op -> 'Node -> UndoClass<'Op>` with `Inverse of 'Op | Compensate of 'Op | OneWay of
reason`, the class computed against the pre-state. The model argues for the CLASS as a function
of the op alone and the INVERSE as a function of the pre-state: `Undo: 'Op -> UndoClass<'Node,
'Op>` with `Inverse of ('Node -> 'Op list)`, `Compensate of ('Node -> 'Op list)`, `OneWay of
reason`. The reason is what `undo_run_restores` makes exact: the posture is read BEFORE the run,
from the declared form, where no pre-state exists — a document computed from a registration has
no state to compute a class against — and the theorem ties that static reading to the dynamic
trail only because the class the posture read of an op is the class the undo meets for the same
op whatever state it was applied to. A member whose case could depend on the state would need a
coherence assumption ("the class answered at the entry state is the class answered at every
intermediate state") that the type now carries for free. The inverse is a LIST because the UI
witness's inverse is a diff (`TreeOpDiff.diff` from the post-state back to the pre-state), and a
diff is a list; a domain whose inverse is one op answers a singleton. Only an op the witness
views as an EDIT is asked.

**2. Reversible versus compensable is the line that matters, and the reason is a LAW.** Both can
be undone. An exact inverse obeys K9 — applied to the state the op produced, the ops the member
answers for the state the op was applied to restore that state, byte for byte through
`Canonical` — and a compensation obeys nothing: a retraction after a publish undoes it in effect
and not in history. Two consequences, both mechanised. A reversible plan can be CHECKED before
anything performs: the undo run folds the inverses against the recorded entry state through
`Stream.Apply` alone and refuses a witness whose inverse breaks the law (`undo-inverse-drift`)
rather than performing it — the one place a broken law can be caught, and the verb's tests pin it
with a lying inverse. A compensable plan reaches whatever its compensations reach
(`undo_run_reaches_compensated`), and the posture says so by its name. So a deployer who reads
`reversible` is being told the undo is verifiable, and one who reads `compensable` that it is
declared. The verdict lattice is `one-way > unknown > compensable > reversible`: a proof that a
step cannot be undone outranks a place the walk could not decide, and either outranks a declared
compensation — the replay classification's rule that only a proof is a finding, applied to a
four-valued answer.

**3. The vocabulary.** Six defects, each a derived fact and never a string a document supplied:
`compensated-op`, `one-way-op` (the member's answer for an edit, both arms of a branch counted
because which arm runs is not decided from the form, a repeat's body once); `opaque-host-call` and
`outbound-notification` (the step reached the world and no inverse vocabulary exists for it);
`emitted-patch` (the host applies it after return, and the host's to undo); and
`compute-outside-fragment` (D21's reversible fragment, read through `BoundedActions.reversible` —
this is where 1976's check composes in, on the dispatch axis, whose inverse is a PROGRAM built
from the form and so needs the exit assertion). A read contributes nothing: it lands a table in
the binding store's query slot, which is the host's cache and which a restored tree's
re-resolution still reads; the undo leaves it, and the ladder says so.

**4. The trail, and where the pre-state lives.** The plan phase records, in plan order, every
EDIT with the state it was applied TO, every compute stage with the trace the fold recorded,
every host call and notification as a step that REACHED, every patch as a step EMITTED. The
pre-state is recorded because an inverse of a write needs the old bytes and the plan phase is the
one place that holds them — the same reason D20 handed the performer the planned state.
`Handler.runPlanned` answers the plan beside the outcome; `runWith` is it without the plan, so no
caller changes. The compute stage now runs the fold TRACED (`runTraced` with the inert arm):
`traced_agrees` says the outcome is the one `runInert` answered, and the UI tier's behaviour is
byte-identical through the parity suite and the Fable leg. In the model the trail is a second walk
over the same views (`trail_views`) and `trail_agrees` says the two walks reach one tree and refuse
alike; production threads it through its one fold, and the undo differential is where the two are
seen to coincide. `run` is unchanged; `run_is_run_planned` ties it to `run_planned`.

**5. The undo run is a handler run, and that is a theorem.** The inverse plan — every edit's
inverse or compensation computed from its recorded pre-state, in reverse plan order — runs as ONE
`ApplyOps` effect through `Handler.runWith` against the store the run left, under the same
registry, performance and resolver: the gate decides `ApplyOps`, the argument policy bounds every
inverse's reach (a deployer's allow-list binds the undo as it bound the run), the registered
performers perform them, and two-phase staging holds. `undo_residual_is_prefix` is
`residual_is_prefix` read for the undo, which is why a failed undo step reports how far it got in
the `PerformFailed` vocabulary rather than in a vocabulary of its own. Then the compute stages'
binding writes are reversed by D21's inverse (`reverse` over each stage's trace, `runReversed`) in
reverse stage order — the tree and the bindings are independent stores, so the two halves compose
exactly. Before any of it: a plan that rolled back is refused (nothing to undo); the FIRST step the
undo cannot perform is refused and NAMED by its ordinal, before anything is undone
(`one_way_position_exact`, `refused_before_anything`) — a one-way op with the domain's reason, a
reached step with its capability, an emitted patch, a compute stage outside the fragment or whose
trace is not restorable (D21's `Trace.restorable`, a run-time fact the static posture cannot see,
so a `reversible` posture is a claim about the form and `undo_run_restores` adds the restorer as
its one run-time hypothesis).

**6. What the phase premised, checked.** The phase as filed composed "1976's reversible-fragment check for
the flow structure" into the classifier "so an unasserted branch is `unknown`, not `reversible`".
Checked against the model: the op-channel branch needs no exit assertion to be undone, because the
undo of this phase is by TRAIL — the plan records the edits the taken arm applied, and the inverse
plan inverts those; D21's exit assertion is what lets an inverse PROGRAM pick the arm to undo
without a trace, which the dispatch axis's reversal does and the op undo does not. So an
op-channel branch without an exit assertion is classed by its arms (both, as reach and replay
count both), `undo_run_restores` carries no hypothesis about exits, and the premise holds exactly
where it was true all along: the DISPATCH axis, where a compute stage outside the fragment —
which includes an unasserted branch — reads `compute-outside-fragment`.

**7. The document.** Version 6 adds `undo`, per handler, beside `replay`, on the argument version
3 made and for the same member shape: present on every server tier, empty where no handler
contributed, so "this producer predates the posture" and "nothing here needs undoing" never share
a spelling. Every envelope signed under version 5 reports `Unreadable` drift naming the version;
the K7 pin was re-signed over the same tree with a fresh key, its tree-hash half still the pre-cut
value. `Harvest.ofProgram` and `ofRegistration` carry both postures from one reachability.

**8. D14 applied a fifth time, and one finding for the next restatement.** A quantified hypothesis
with four bound variables and an antecedent on a projection (`forall op pre post f. apply op pre
== ROk post /\ cls op == Inverse f ==> …`) is not reliably instantiated by the solver inside a
recursive lemma; the law was restated as a LEMMA-TYPED parameter (`inverse_law w cls` is an arrow
to `Lemma`, and `undo_run_restores` takes `law: inverse_law w cls`) and called explicitly at the
one step that needs it. This is the shape to reach for first when a theorem is conditional on a
witness obligation: the hypothesis is named in the signature, no pattern is guessed, and the
ladder's "conditional on" is literally the argument list. The module checks in ten seconds under
the pinned flags, alone and in context, with `--quake 3`.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking
of this class — `StateWitness` gains a member, every full-literal witness construction gains a
line; `Demanded.Version` is 6. `STABILITY.md` has the consumer's account and
`docs/migrations/phase-1977.md` the diff.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** The undo of a run that ROLLED BACK after a
perform-phase failure — undoing the prefix `residual_is_prefix` reports — is not offered; the
record exists (the plan carries `Committed`) and a later phase that wants it has the trail. A
landed read is not undone, by decision (item 3), until the store has a member that forgets a
slot, which no witness has asked for. The class of an op is a function of the op; a domain whose
undoability genuinely depends on the state answers `Compensate` with a compensation that reads
the state, and reads `compensable` — the honest word for an inverse that cannot be checked
against a law.

## D23 — The durable interpreter journals EVERY arm that reaches outside: a performed op stage is a journaled step at its ordinal, its subject is the op's content address, the op performer is declared like a host performer, and the journal extension is not a specification act (2026-10-02)

D12 journaled "the ONE arm that reaches outside" and gave D8's reason: a query reads, an op edits an
in-memory tree the caller may discard, a patch and a notification accumulate as values the caller
performs after the handler returns — none performed by the handler, so none performable twice. D19
then gave ops a registered performer (`OpPerformance.Performed`): every op of a committed plan is
staged as a call of its own and performed in the perform phase beside the host calls. From that
commit D12's premise was false for any domain that registers one — a performed op reaches outside
exactly as a host call does — and D19 chose to say so ("the durable interpreter runs in memory and
journals no performed op; a verb under the durable tier is stated as not covered") rather than extend
the journal. This decision extends it, and restates D12's premise: **what is journaled is every arm
that reaches outside** — the host call, and the op stage where a performer is registered. Under
`InMemory` nothing is performed and nothing new is journaled, byte for byte.

**1. An op stage is a journaled step, through the same wrapper and the same cursor.** `Durable.runWith`
takes the placement's `OpPerformance` beside its registry and wraps the op performer exactly as it
wraps a host function: ONE `wrapAt`, one ordinal cursor, so an op stage and a host call take their
ordinals from the one sequence in perform order — the plan phase is deterministic, so a replay reaches
ordinal *n* holding the same staged call the recorded run held there, whichever arm it is. The
attempt / invoke / record order is unchanged: `Attempted` before the performer, `Completed` or
`Refused` after, the third readable state ("attempted, no result") declared rather than closed, its
replay refused by default, `acceptingIndeterminateReplay` the named opt-in with its override record,
and a performer declared `Idempotent` closing the window by its own shape. The alternative — a
second journal keyed by op, or a second cursor for op stages — was refused for D12's own reason read
once more: two ledgers over one perform phase is a second account of what ran, kept in step by hand.
`Durable.run` keeps its signature as `runWith` at `InMemory`, on the terms `Handler.run` kept its
(D19); `Durable.arm` passes the host's performance, so a session whose ops reach the world is covered
without a second arm. `DurableControls` gains the same `runWith` beside its `run`.

**2. The entry is filed under `ApplyOps` with the op's CONTENT ADDRESS as its subject.** A host call's
capability names its function; two ops share a capability, so the capability alone cannot say which
op a step was about, and the divergence check — the one thing that stands between a replay and
serving one call's answer to another — would pass on any op at a recorded op ordinal. `JournalEntry`
therefore gains `Subject: string option`: `None` for a host call, and for an op stage
`sha256:` + the digest of the op's canonical form, read off the state axis's own codec
(`StateWitness.Stream.Encode`, K6 — the shard named `StateWitness.Canonical`, which canonicalises the
STATE, and that is exactly the member this must not read: the state handed beside an op is the planned
state, recomputed on replay, not the thing performed). A hash rather than the form itself, for the
reason `Journal.describe` renders no value: an op can carry a payload, and the journal's identity for a
step must stay log-safe and fixed-size — the same shape, for the same reason, as the tree hash a
signed envelope binds. The divergence check compares the subject beside the capability; a replay that
reaches a recorded ordinal holding another op refuses with `durable-replay-divergence`, as it always
did for another arm.

**3. The op performer is DECLARED like a host performer, and the facet derivation reads the
registration as a fact.** `PerformerFacets` gains `OpPerformer: IdempotencyFacet option`
(`declareOpPerformer`; `DurableServices.declaringOpPerformer`): a domain whose op is a
content-addressed write declares it `Idempotent` and reaches `ExactlyOnceEffective`, one whose op is a
push cannot claim it without saying so, and undeclared reads `NonIdempotent` on the terms an
undeclared host function always has. The derivation (`Facets.ofEffect` and everything above it, and
`Durable.guarantees` / `declaration` / `checkDeclaration`) now takes the placement's `OpPerformance`:
under a registered performer `ApplyOps` is derived on a host call's terms — strict may LOSE, accepting
may DUPLICATE, exactly-once only where declared — and in memory it is the recomputed arm it always
was. The registration is PASSED rather than declared on the facets, deliberately: a host that
registers a performer and declares nothing about it must read as an undeclared performer (reported
under `ApplyOps` by `checkDeclaration`), never as the recomputed arm it no longer is. A declaration
that also asserted the registration would be a second source of the same fact, free to disagree.

**4. The discipline is PROVED before the code moved (D14), in the staging model.** `Staging.fst`
gains the durable discipline beside the handler it wraps, over the same staged list: the journal as a
SNAPSHOT read once at entry (`journal`), the wrapper's decision per ordinal (`decide`), the perform
phase through it (`replay`) and `durable_run`. Eight theorems: a completed prefix is served and only
the rest is performed (`replay_serves_completed`, `replay_unrun_is_perform`,
`resume_performs_only_the_rest`, and `durable_resume` at the handler); an undecided step under an
undeclared performer with the opt-in off is refused before it and everything after it
(`indeterminate_refused_by_default`); it is re-invoked in exactly the two named cases and nowhere
else (`indeterminate_reinvoked_only_by_name`); a recorded ordinal holding another identity is refused
(`divergence_refused` — the subject's reason, as a theorem); and with nothing recorded the durable
run's outcome IS the direct run's (`empty_journal_is_direct`). `plan_pure` and the prefix theorems
re-prove unchanged, because the wrapper changes `r_perf`'s behaviour and nothing the plan phase reads.
The journal's WRITES and its storage stay the host's port and out of the theorem. The differential
host (`DurableInterpreterTests`, "the proved durable replay as oracle") runs the extraction beside
`Durable.runWith` over every journal shape the crash fixtures leave — nothing recorded, interrupted
between stages, a crash inside a stage under each policy, a served refusal, a diverging op — and it
went red first, on a model staged list a comprehension had shortened to two calls, before it went
green.

**5. The specification act is DECIDED: the journal extension needs no specification change.** PROGRAM
WIRE §6.2 ("only `HostCall` is staged") and §6.4 (`PerformFailed` over host calls) describe the
in-memory placement, which every conformant host had and every UI host still has; D19 left carrying
the performer case into the normative text as a specification act, and this phase does not take it,
for three reasons that are each sufficient. (a) **The effect journal is not a wire artefact.** It is
a host-internal port (`EffectJournal`: append, read, a restart claim) with no document, no schema, no
fixture and no refusal class in the specification — the host-call steps it has journaled since D12
were never specified either, and an op stage's entry is the same record with one more member. (b)
**No specified member moves.** The outcome document is unchanged: `performed` carried `ApplyOps` once
per performed op from D19 on, under the hook that "changes no wire at all", and this phase changes
what is RECORDED about those stages, not what is reported. (c) **§7.1 is checked and holds.** "A
conformant host MUST NOT journal a handler invocation as a replayable record" — and nothing here
journals an invocation. A journaled op stage is a step record keyed to an ordinal within an
invocation, served so the step is not performed twice; it is not an artefact from which a host
re-issues the invocation, and the invocation-level marker this interpreter already writes is an
audit fact a replay never short-circuits on. §7.1's own words are "ops, not invocations", and an op
stage's entry is, to the letter, an op. The one thing this decision records for the specification's
own follow-on is unchanged from D19: carrying the performer case into §6.2 remains a specification
act across five artefacts, and the sentence a registered performer reads past is still §6.2's, not
§7's.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking of
this class. `JournalEntry` and `PerformerFacets` each gain a member (FS0764 on a full-literal
construction — a host's persistent journal that constructs entries, and nothing else in this
repository), and `Facets.ofEffect` / `ofHandler` / `ofHandlers` / `declare` / `checkDeclaration` and
`Durable.guarantees` / `declaration` / `checkDeclaration` take the performance. No wire member, no
fixture byte, and the UI tier byte for byte: `Durable.run` is unchanged in signature and behaviour.
`STABILITY.md` has the consumer's account.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** A performed op's receipt — what the performer can say it
did, and a return contract over it — is Phase 1981's, and this decision assumes nothing about it: the
journaled value for an op stage is the inert object the staged call already answers, and a receipt
rides there when it exists. The operator controls (`Controls.revoke`) still name a host performer by
function and cannot withdraw the op performer, which has no name; that is a finding, not a decision.
The journal's writes are two acts to two systems and the indeterminate window stays declared, not
closed, exactly as D12 left it — what this decision adds is that the window is now the same window
for an op stage, read, refused and overridden by the same code.

## D24 — An op performer's claim is CHECKED: it answers a receipt, a contract over (planned state, op, receipt) is declared at registration in the `registerChecked` shape, the reach obligation runs both ways, and no specification act is taken (2026-10-02)

Phase 1759 gave host functions a checked return — `ReturnContract`, composed with a performer by
`ServerEffectRegistry.registerChecked`, proved by `return_contract` — and D19 (Phase 1967), landing
the same day, gave ops a registered performer and said it is "trusted on the terms a host function
is". It was trusted on weaker ones: `OpPerformance.Performed` answered `Result<unit, string>`, so a
performer could say only that it succeeded, and no contract could check what it did. D19 decision 2
stated the reach obligation in one direction only — a reach must never be a payload — and nothing
stated the other: that the reach covers what the performer touches, which is the direction a policy
enforced against reach (a lease, a deny-list, a worker grant — the use a second instantiation that
performs ops has planned, roadmap-engine#703) actually depends on. This decision amends both. **The op performer is
constrained on the terms a host function is**, and **the reach obligation is stated both ways and is
checkable through the receipt where the domain can say how.**

**1. The performer answers a RECEIPT, and `Performed` is widened rather than doubled.**
`OpPerformance.Performed` carries `'Node -> 'Op -> Result<Fuaran.Core.JVal, string>`: the value a host
call's contract already reads, so one contract vocabulary serves both arms. The receipt is what the
performer says it did — the paths it wrote, the sha it committed, the blocks it rendered — in the
domain's own shape; it lands in no slot (`Into = None`, as an op always has), reaches no wire, and is
recorded by the durable journal as the step's completed value (D23: "a receipt rides there when it
exists"). A second `OpPerformance` case was refused for the reason D23 refused a second journal: the
contract is a WRAPPER over the performer, and composing it at registration — `performedChecked
contract perform = Performed (OpContract.check contract perform)` — is exactly the `registerChecked`
shape, so every match site (the handler's plan fold, the durable wrapper, the facet derivation, the
oracle bridge) keeps ONE arm and ONE perform loop, where a second case would have put the same
wrapper into each of them by hand. A performer with nothing to say registers through
`performedWithoutReceipt`, whose receipt is the inert empty object the staged call always answered.

**2. The contract is over (planned state, op, receipt), and is a return contract AT the op.**
`OpContract<'Node, 'Op>` is `{ Name; Holds: 'Node -> 'Op -> JVal -> bool }`; `OpContract.describe` is
`return-contract:<name>`, the ONE refusal vocabulary a return contract has — the op axis coins no
second prefix, so a reader of a `PerformFailed` reason learns which contract and not which arm, which
is what a denial has always told them. `OpContract.check` is `ReturnContract.check` with the state and
the op in hand, clause for clause: a raw refusal through unchanged, a receipt that holds through, a
receipt that does not become the contract's name and never the receipt. The three arguments are the
whole point: a contract that could not see the op could not know its reach, and one that could not
see the state could not check a receipt against what the plan produced.

**3. Proved first (D14), as a reading of `return_contract` made visible, plus the identity for the
uncontracted case.** `EffectGate.fst` gains `op_contract`, `check_op` (production's wrapper),
`op_at` (the return contract an op contract IS at one state and op), and the bridge
`op_contract_keyed`: in production the contract is composed INTO the closure the plan phase stages
as the op's token, and in the model that is the hypothesis that the token staged for (state, op)
carries the contract at (state, op). Four theorems: `check_op_is_check_return` (one check, two
keyings); `op_token_checked` (under the keying, the behaviour the perform phase sees for an op token
IS `check_op` over the raw behaviour); **`op_return_contract`** — the three clauses of
`return_contract` and two more in the op's own vocabulary: every landed receipt of an op stage
honours the contract at the state and the op it was staged from (`op_receipts_honour`), and when the
first rejected result is an op stage's, `PerformFailed` at that position names THIS contract, the
handler is rolled back and `Performed` is exactly the stages before it; and
**`uncontracted_is_direct`** — the handler's outcome under the wrapper that declares nothing is its
outcome under the raw registry, as an equation, which is "a performer with no contract behaves
exactly as today" as a theorem rather than a reading, and is why the staging and gate theorems
re-prove unchanged for it. The model identifies an op stage by its TOKEN, not by its capability
string, because the prover reasons about neither string content nor `strcat` inequalities
(`strcat "host:" fn =!= "ApplyOps"` is unprovable there), and a token is what the staged call
carries anyway. A go-red mutant — `check_op` accepting a rejected receipt — fails `op_token_checked`
as it should. The differential host runs the extracted `check_op` beside `OpContract.check` over 48
(state, op, behaviour, verdict) cases, with the (state, op) handed to the contract recorded and
compared on both sides.

**4. The reach obligation, both ways.** D19's direction stands: a reach is a NAME and never a payload.
The new direction is on the witness beside it: **an op's reach covers what its performer touches when
handed the op** (`docs/generic-tier.md` §3.5). The receipt is the domain's route to checking it — the
in-repo verb witness answers the paths and targets it touched and `Receipt.withinReach` checks each
against the reach's `path` and `target` arguments; its `Escaping` adversary, which writes a path the
op's reach does not name and says so, is refused with `return-contract:within-reach`, the op absent
from `Performed`, the escaped path in no diagnostic. What is checked is the performer's ACCOUNT, and
`docs/performer-boundary.md` says so: a performer that overreached and reported only what was within
reach passes, exactly as a host function whose result satisfies its contract passes whatever else it
did — which is why the obligation is stated on the witness and the theorem claims the check, not the
coverage. The document witness is unchanged: `Fuaran.Doc`'s sink has nothing to say beyond success,
and registers through `performedWithoutReceipt`.

**5. The durable tier records a refusal, never a false completion.** `Durable.runWith`'s wrapper
hands the op stage's performer through unchanged — the contract is inside the performer as registered
— so a receipt the contract rejects reaches the wrapper as `Error "return-contract:<name>"` and is
journaled as `Refused` at its ordinal: a decided step, served on replay as the same refusal, never a
`Completed` value and never the indeterminate window. `DurableInterpreterTests` pins the journal's
rendering for both the receipt (the completed value IS the receipt) and the refusal.

**6. The specification act is DECIDED: none.** Return contracts are host-declared and never specified
(Phase 1759 added none). A receipt reaches no wire member — it lands in no binding, appears in no
outcome document, and the journal that records it is the host-internal port D23 item 5(a) already
found outside the specification. Its contract's refusal rides PROGRAM WIRE §6.4's `PerformFailed`
`reason`, which already carries "the performer's own text": `return-contract:<name>` has been that
text for a host call since Phase 1759, and an op stage's `PerformFailed` under `ApplyOps` has been D19's
since Phase 1967. No specified member moves, no fixture byte moves, and the one sentence a registered
performer reads past is still §6.2's, on D19's and D23's terms.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking of
this class. `OpPerformance.Performed`'s payload type changes (every registered performer and every
`performedBy` caller — in this repository the two witnesses and three test suites); `OpContract`,
`OpPerformance.performedChecked` and `performedWithoutReceipt` are new. No wire member, no fixture
byte, and the UI tier byte for byte: `InMemory` is untouched and `Handler.run` unchanged.
`STABILITY.md` has the consumer's account.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** A receipt that lands in a binding slot — the op arm
gaining an `Into` — is NOT taken: it would make `ApplyOps` a dispatch-axis consumer, and a domain that
wants a receipt in its state can write it as an op. The operator controls' inability to withdraw the
op performer (D23's finding) stands. A contract keyed by capability STRING in the model is foreclosed
by the prover (item 3); a model that distinguishes op tokens from host tokens by a token-side
predicate is the shape a stronger statement would take, and nothing yet needs it.

## D25 — The outcome names the arms it took, a state-only composition has a handler document, and a ceiling clause bounds a number; no specification act and no theorem statement moves (2026-10-02)

The second witness's third run (roadmap-engine#703) placed two store-mutating verbs on this domain
against the Phase 1976 build. It found three gaps that are generic to any domain rather than that
domain's own vocabulary, and so this repository's under D18. The run worked round each one. None of them should
need working round.

**1. B3: the handler outcome carries its flow decisions, host-side.** `HandlerOutcome` gains
`Flow: FlowDecision list`, where `FlowDecision` is `Chose of tookTrue` or `Repeated of count`.
- **Order:** plan order and pre-order, so a branch's or a repeat's own decision comes before the
  decisions inside it.
- **Both axes feed it.** The op axis (`OpView.Choose` / `OpView.Repeat`) is threaded through
  `planOps` beside the undo trail. A compute stage's fold is read off the trace it already records
  (`FlowDecision.ofTrace`). There is one fold and no second walk.
- **The event tally carries it too.** `HandlerTally.Flow` holds the flows of the handlers an event
  invoked, in invocation order, so the session placement can report them.
- **On a rolled-back outcome** it names the decisions taken before the effect that halted, on the
  terms `Diagnostics` survives a rollback. An op effect whose plan was refused contributes nothing of
  its own, because its plan was refused whole.
- **Why the run needed it.** It mapped a verb's arm onto an exit code by reading the conditions a
  second time. That is sound only while no arm writes what a condition reads, and the outcome is now
  the reading.

Two things were decided rather than defaulted:
- **Host-side, not on the wire.** `HandlerReport` does not carry `Flow`, so the outcome document the
  specification describes is byte-identical, and the UI tier's outcomes are byte-identical because no
  UI handler uses either shape. Putting the arm trace on the wire would be a specification act
  across all five artefacts. The one consumer so far reads the outcome in-process, so nothing yet
  pays for that act.
- **No theorem statement moves.** The flow is an observation threaded beside the plan; it changes
  neither the store, the staged list, `Performed` nor a halt. `Staging.fst` and `BoundedFold.fst`
  say nothing about it, and the oracle bridge fills it empty and does not compare it. Its claim (it
  names the arms the plan took) is tested, not proved: the verb domain covers both arms, a nested
  repeat and a halt, and the toy domain covers a compute stage. Disabling the op-axis push turns
  three of those tests red. A model of it would be `trail_views`' shape, a second walk proved to
  agree with the fold, and it waits for a consumer that needs the claim proved.

**2. H1: the handler codecs run under every composition.** `HandlerWire` was typed at a full dispatch
axis, so a domain that fills only the state axis could not encode a handler as a Program document,
and so could not bind a signed envelope to one (D15).
- `HandlerWire`, `Replay` and `Harvest.ofRegistration` now read the dispatch position through
  `IDispatchPosition`, as the handler loop and the demand walk already did.
- `ProgramWire` gains `decodeActionIn` and `replayDefectsOfActionIn` over the action witness alone,
  and the full-axis functions delegate to them.
- **A compute stage decoded at such a composition** is refused on `malformed-referenced-value`: the
  action is a referenced value and there is no vocabulary to decode it. That class is the
  specification's own, so no refusal class is added.
- **A landing slot decodes**, because a composition without a binding channel has no reserved
  namespace to check it against. The handler refuses it while planning (`no-binding-channel`), which
  is still before anything external runs.
- `HandlerWire.contentAddress` is the specification's `sha256:` form over the canonical handler
  document.
- `SignedEnvelope.signAddressed` / `verifyAddressed` sign and verify a content address paired with a
  demanded projection. `sign` / `verify` are now those with the tree's hash and its walk, byte for
  byte as before.
- Verification stays recomputation: the caller recomputes the address and the projection from the
  registration it holds, and the carried bytes have no say. A changed handler whose demand did not
  move is a bad signature, and a relaxed policy is drift.

The in-repo verb domain gained an op decoder, `encodeOp`'s inverse, so its handlers round-trip.

**3. R2: `ServerConstraintClause.AtMost(argument, limit)`.** Every value under the argument must read
as an integer no greater than the limit.
- **What counts as an integer.** Only the canonical decimal spelling: an optional minus sign, no
  sign on zero, no leading zero, no whitespace, at most eighteen digits. Anything else is refused,
  because a second spelling of one number would pass the bound under one reading and reach the
  performer under another.
- **Refusal token:** `OffList argument`, the allow-list's, which names the argument and never the
  value. The clause is vacuously true where the effect names nothing under the argument, on the
  allow-list's reading.
- **Integer members are now arguments.** A host call's top-level integer members join its string
  members, as decimal text. Without that, an `AtMost` on a numeric argument would pass vacuously
  over exactly the value it bounds. It also tightens an existing allow-list on such a name, which
  used to pass over the number unseen and now sees it.
  This reverses a limit this repository had stated, "a top-level member whose value is a string",
  in the policy module's header and in an `EffectConstraintTests` case that pinned it. Both are
  amended. The limit was a statement of scope rather than an argument for it, and nesting stays
  out of scope.
- **Rides document version 6** on the argument `denyList` rode version 5: no producer of a version-6
  document before it could declare one, a reader built before it refuses a document that carries
  one at the clause, and the version belongs to an unreleased draft.
- **No proof moves.** `EffectGate.fst` takes the argument policy as an arbitrary function, and its
  theorems hold for every policy (the `plan_effect` congruence over `r_policy`).
- The demanded corpus (`conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json`, Phase 1978) carries the clause
  in its policy vector and is regenerated.

**What this does not do.** It records no flow on the wire, as item 1 says. It models no flow, also
item 1. It adds no `AtMost` for non-integer quantities: a byte size is `Ceiling`'s, and no other
quantity has a consumer.

## D26 — The op performer is revocable: a fixed reserved key names it, and a revoke of that key refuses every op stage at its ordinal, before the stage is attempted, in both interpreters (2026-10-02)

D23 closed with a finding, not a decision: "the operator controls (`Controls.revoke`) still name a
host performer by function and cannot withdraw the op performer, which has no name". A revoke is a
registry edit (`Controls.apply` removes the named function), the op performer is not a registry
member — it is the placement's `OpPerformance`, handed to the interpreter beside the registry — and
so an operator who revoked every host performer still had ops performed. `Durable.fs`'s controls
header claimed the opposite: that wrapping the registry left "no arm of the vocabulary a control can
be forgotten for". It was true of every arm but this one. This decision closes the finding.

**1. The identity is a FIXED, RESERVED key — `OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`, which is `"ApplyOps"` —
not a name the host declares at registration.** The phase left both open. A declared name was
weighed and refused on three grounds. (a) **It has nothing to distinguish.** A placement registers at
most one op performer, which is why `PerformerFacets.OpPerformer` is one slot rather than a key
(D23 §3), and a control stream is scoped to one session, so the key need only be told apart from the
host's own function names in that session — never from a second op performer. (b) **It would be a
second identity for an arm that already has one.** The op stage is gated, throttled
(`ThrottleWindow.Capability = "ApplyOps"` already throttles it), journaled (`Durable.OpStageCapability`)
and reported (`checkDeclaration`'s undeclared-performer line) under `ApplyOps`. A declared name
would be the one place the arm is called something else, free to drift from the rest. (c) **It costs
a breaking change for no capability.** Every registration function and every match on
`OpPerformance.Performed` would change — across the server package, the verb and document
witnesses, and the extraction tests — to carry a string nothing else reads. The rule in `Journal.fs`
("what a control record may carry") holds: the key is vocabulary, never a payload. **The cost, stated
rather than hidden:** a host function the host has itself registered under the name `ApplyOps` shares
the key, so one revoke withdraws both arms. That is the over-broad direction, which is the safe one for
a kill switch, and the alternative — a revoke of the key that skips the like-named host function —
would leave that function unrevocable. A future host with two op performers in one session (none
exists, and the type admits one) is the trigger to revisit, and the revisit is a declared name.

**2. A revoked op performer refuses at the op STAGE — at the stage's ordinal, in the perform phase,
before the performer is invoked — and not while planning.** A revoked host performer is refused while
planning: removed from the registry, its call reads as `Unregistered` and the handler performs
nothing. The op stage cannot be refused at that point, and should not be. The plan phase never looks
the op performer up (an edit is applied in memory and STAGED whatever is registered), so the stage is
the first point the performer would be reached; and refusing there is what lets a resumed durable run
SERVE the stages its journal recorded and refuse the first it did not, which a plan-time refusal
would deny — it would report a run whose recorded prefix reached the world as one that performed
nothing. The consequence is D8's residual, unchanged in shape: a host call staged BEFORE the op stage
has performed and is named in `Performed`, and the op stage fails as
`PerformFailed("ApplyOps", "control-performer-revoked")`. The control record is
`ControlRefusal.Revoked("ApplyOps", actor, reason)`, the shape a revoked host call's has; and
`describeRefusal` now renders a revocation as "refused — its performer was withdrawn by …", because
its old text ("reads as unregistered") was false of an op stage.

**3. Both interpreters, through one decision.** `Controls.opPerformerRevocation` reads the key out of
the folded `Revoked` map, and `Controls.opStageRefusal` turns it into the stage's refusal, recording
the `ControlRefusal` as it answers. The DIRECT interpreter takes it through
`Controls.performance`, beside `Controls.apply` for the registry: a withdrawn op performer is replaced
by one that answers the refusal, so the registered performer is never invoked. The DURABLE interpreter
takes it through a hook rather than through a replaced performer, and the difference is deliberate:
the hook is asked only for a stage the journal has NOT served, and before the `Attempted` record, so a
refused stage leaves the effect journal untouched. A replaced performer would have been invoked inside
the journal's attempt / invoke / record order, writing `Attempted` and `Refused` for a step that
reached nothing — and a later run would then SERVE that refusal from the effect journal instead of
re-deciding it from the control stream, which is where the act lives. `Durable.runGuarded` /
`armGuarded` are the uncontrolled interpreter with that one hook exposed (internal);
`Durable.runWith` / `run` / `arm` pass the refusal that never refuses and are unchanged in signature
and behaviour, and `DurableControls.runWith` / `arm` / `stepVia` pass the controls' refusal.

**4. Monotonicity is unchanged.** `Controls.step` gains no arm and no arm removes a key from
`Revoked`, so a withdrawn op performer stays withdrawn across every prefix of the stream; a `Resume`
lifts the suspend and nothing else; and because the refusal is re-decided from the control stream on
every run rather than journaled, a resumed run is refused exactly as the first was.

**5. In memory there is nothing to withdraw.** Under `OpPerformance.InMemory` the apply is the effect,
performed while planning, and nothing reaches outside; a revoke of the key changes nothing there, and
`Controls.performance` returns the value it was handed.

**6. The facets name the op performer by its key.** `checkDeclaration`'s undeclared-performer line
for the op performer is filed under `OpPerformance.RegistrationKey` and its detail names it, so a
finding names every performer by the key a revoke would use — `host:<key>` for a host function, the
key itself for the op performer. No member is added to the facet vocabulary: the key IS the
capability the line was already filed under, which is item 1's point (b) read from the other side.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft as an additive change: new members
(`OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`, `Controls.opPerformerRevocation` / `opStageRefusal` / `performance`)
and a refusal path a session reaches only by recording a revoke of the key. No wire member, no fixture
byte, no control-stream byte and no proof statement moves; a session that revokes nothing runs byte
for byte as before, in memory and durably, journal entry for entry. `STABILITY.md` has the consumer's
account, including the one behaviour a host already recording revokes can observe.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** It forecloses an op performer with a host-chosen name;
item 1 names the trigger to reopen it. It leaves the demanded-effect COVERAGE check unaware of a
withdrawn op performer: `Controls.coverage` reads the registry, which never held the op performer, so
a host whose op performer is revoked is still reported as covering `ApplyOps`. Coverage asks whether
the host HAS a capability, and in-memory ops are covered whatever is revoked, so the honest answer
needs the placement's performance beside the registry; that is a change to the coverage question,
not to the controls, and is left for the phase that asks it. And the staging model
(`proofs/Staging.fst`) is untouched: to the model a refused stage is a performer that answers a
refusal at its ordinal, which `r_perf` already quantifies over, and the journal's WRITES — the one
thing the hook does differently from such a performer — are outside the theorem (D23 §4), so nothing a
theorem states moves.

## D27 — The proof hosts stage an op token that CARRIES the planned state and the op, so `op_return_contract` runs differentially at the handler and `op_contract_keyed` is tested rather than assumed; production's types are unchanged (2026-10-02)

D24 proved `op_return_contract` for a whole handler run, conditional on the bridge `op_contract_keyed`:
the token the plan phase stages for (state, op) carries the op contract AT (state, op). Its
differential evidence stopped one level below the statement. The staging and effect-gate hosts in
`tests/Fuaran.Program.Server.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs` instantiate the model's performer token as
production's own closure — `GateToken = string * Performer` for a host call, and for an op the
closure over the state as of the op — and the model's `checked_by` keys a contract on a token, which a
closure cannot be inspected for. So what ran was the wrapper (`OpContract.check` beside the extracted
`check_op`, 48 cases) and the verb witness end to end; the bridge was true by construction in
production and never exercised against the model. This decision records why the host's token now
differs from production's, and what that buys.

**1. The host's op token is `OpToken (state, op)` — test typing, not a production change.** The
op-contract host's `r_op_perform` answers, for each (state, op) the plan phase stages, a token that
carries that planned state and that op, beside a `HostToken (fn, performer)` for host calls; the
model's per-token contract keys `OpToken (s, o)` to `op_at contract s o`, which is the keying
`op_contract_keyed` states, and the raw behaviour applies the host's own op performer to the
token's (s, o). Production keeps its closure: `OpPerformance`, `OpContract`, `Handler.stagedOp` and
`Durable.runWith` are untouched, and nothing in `src/` moves. The two tokens differ ON PURPOSE. A
closure is what production needs — the contract composed into the performer before the plan phase
splits it, so every match site keeps one arm — and it is exactly what makes the bridge true by
construction and therefore untestable. Data is what the model needs: a contract can be keyed on it,
and a keying that is wrong can be written down and shown to lose. The host is where the two meet, so
the host is where the token is chosen, and it is chosen to carry what the hypothesis quantifies over.
Carrying the canonical forms instead (a state hash and the op's content address) was considered and
not taken: the model's contract is handed whatever the token holds, and the state itself is what
production's contract is handed, so carrying the value keeps the two contracts one predicate.

**2. What the differential compares, and how it can lose.** Forty cases — five plans (an op alone,
two ops in one stage, an op then a checked host call, a host call then an op, host call / op / host
call / op) at four op-performer behaviours (honest, foreign, honest then foreign, a raw refusal),
contracted and uncontracted — run the extracted `Staging.run` with the extracted `checked_by` beside
`Handler.runWith` under `OpPerformance.performedChecked`, comparing the outcome and the one
performer log on which host calls and every op's handed (state, op) are recorded. The honest receipt
names the planned state's hash and the op's content address, so a contract keyed on the wrong state
or the wrong op rejects it. The go-red keying is the right contract on the right op at the ENTRY
state: run against the main differential while the host was authored it lost ten of the forty
cases, and the committed GO RED case pins the loss. The durable reading runs the same cases under
`Durable.runWith` beside the extracted `durable_run`, comparing the ordinals and the decided steps —
production's journal records against the model's invoked ordinals with the staged call's capability,
subject (read off the token's op) and wrapped answer — and resumes both over the journal production
left. A contract-rejected receipt journals as `Refused` at its ordinal on both sides and is served
on resume without invoking.

**3. The ladder moves; no theorem does.** `proofs/README.md` moves `op_contract_keyed` from the
assumed rung to the differentially tested one and cites the host for `op_return_contract` at the
handler level; `proofs.json` gains `op-contract-keyed-agrees-at-the-handler` (tested);
`proofs/check.ps1` names the host under the effect-gate module's `HostSubject` and raises that list's
`HostMinCases` from 7 to 12. The hypothesis stays a hypothesis in `EffectGate.fst` — the token is
opaque in the model, which is the point of the model — and no `.fst`, no extraction, no wire member
and no fixture byte changes. The parity host (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Parity.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs`)
stages no op token and is unchanged.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** It forecloses reading "true by construction" as
evidence: a bridge hypothesis whose production side is a closure is now tested by a host that stages
data, and a later bridge of that shape should be tested the same way. It leaves the per-token
distinction in the model as D24 left it — op tokens and host tokens are told apart by the host's
keying, not by a token-side predicate in the model — and the host-call contract keyed by function
NAME (`effect-gate-bridge-assumed`) on the assumed rung, since `registerChecked` keys it that way and
no closure stands between the two.

## D28 — Control coverage reads the op performer: a revoked op performer closes coverage's gate over `ApplyOps`, `Controls.coverage` takes the placement's performance, and the durable form reads it from the host record (2026-10-02)

D26 closed with a clause it left open: "it leaves the demanded-effect COVERAGE check unaware of a
withdrawn op performer". `Controls.coverage` and `DurableControls.coverage` read the registry, the op
performer was never a member of it, and so a placement whose operator had revoked
`OpPerformance.RegistrationKey` refused every op stage at run time while its coverage still reported
`ApplyOps` covered. The revoke worked and the report said it had not. This decision closes the clause
(Phase 1986).

**1. Coverage reads the placement's `OpPerformance` beside the registry.** Under
`OpPerformance.Performed`, with the key in `Revoked`, coverage's gate refuses `ApplyOps`; in every
other case coverage is exactly the registry's under the controls, as before. The rule is the one
`Controls.performance` already applies to the run, so the report and the effect are decided from the
same two facts — the folded control state and the placement's performance — and cannot disagree.

**2. The withdrawal is carried by the GATE, so the finding is
`CoverageFinding.ServerGateRefusesCapability "ApplyOps"`, not an absence.** This is the call that
needed deciding, and it is decided against the reading that looks more natural. A withdrawn HOST
performer reads as `UnregisteredServerFunction` because the coverage vocabulary has a registration
fact for host functions (`ServerCoverage.HostFunctions`) and a revoke removes the function from it.
It has NO registration fact for the op arm: `ApplyOps` is one of the arms that need no performer and
"only ever meet the gate" (`Demanded.fs`, `ServerCoverage`), so the gate is the one fact coverage
holds about it, and a withdrawal of the arm can only be said there. Saying it as an absence would
need a new `ServerCoverage` member (an op-performer slot) and a new `CoverageFinding` arm — a record
gaining a field breaks every full-literal construction and a closed DU gaining a case breaks every
exhaustive match, both in `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`, whose coverage model is placement-generic and
knows nothing of an op performer. That is a larger change to a different package for a distinction
no consumer branches on today. **The cost, stated rather than hidden:** `CoverageFinding`'s note says
only the gate arm "is resolved by changing policy", and a revoke is monotone — no `Resume` lifts it.
The suspend already reports through this arm (a suspended session has the capability and refuses
it), so the gate finding already means "refused by policy OR by an operator's control", and the
op-performer revoke joins the suspend there. **The trigger to revisit** is a consumer that must tell
a revoked op performer from a policy refusal from the coverage report alone; the revisit is an
op-performer slot on `ServerCoverage` with its own finding, filed against `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`.

> **Amended by D37 (2026-10-08, Phase 1993):** the operator ruled the revisit on 2026-10-02 — a
> revoke is permanent, so a revoked op performer reads as an absence. `ServerCoverage.Withdrawn` is
> the slot and `CoverageFinding.ServerCapabilityWithdrawn` the finding; this item's gate reading is
> superseded. Items 1 and 3–6 stand.

**3. Coverage carries no actor and no reason, for either kind of performer — the phase's premise
that a withdrawn host capability is reported "naming the actor and reason" was checked and is false
of coverage.** `ServerCoverage` is a vocabulary and a gate; a withdrawn host function's finding names
the function and nothing else. The actor and reason live in the control state coverage was read from
— `Controls.opPerformerRevocation` for the op performer, `ControlState.Revoked` for both — and on the
`ControlRefusal.Revoked` record a run produces. The tests assert both from one fold: the finding names
the key the revoke used, and the state it was computed from names who and why. Putting the actor into
`ServerCoverage` would be item 2's breaking change to `Fuaran.Program.Bounded` again, and for a host
function as much as for the op performer — a widening of the coverage question beyond this phase,
not a gap in its answer.

**4. `Controls.coverage` gains the performance as a parameter; `DurableControls.coverage` keeps its
signature and reads `host.OpPerformance`.** For the durable form the host record already carries the
performance, so the input arrives through a value the caller passes today and nothing breaks. For
`Controls.coverage` a second function beside the old one was weighed and refused: the old one's
contract is "coverage with the controls in force", and left registry-only it would go on answering
that question wrongly for every performing placement — a function that lies by omission is debt, and
this side's doctrine forbids it. Its one in-repository caller is `DurableControls.coverage`; a direct
caller passes `OpPerformance.InMemory` to reproduce the old answer exactly. The change rides the
`0.7.0` draft, which is already of the breaking class; `STABILITY.md` has the consumer's account.

**5. In memory there is nothing to withdraw, and coverage says so by covering `ApplyOps`.** Under
`OpPerformance.InMemory` the apply is the effect, performed while planning, and nothing reaches
outside (D26 §5); a revoke of the key changes nothing at run time, so coverage reports the arm
covered. The phase's wording ("coverage says so rather than claiming `ApplyOps`") is read in that
sense — coverage does not claim a withdrawal that did not happen — because reporting `ApplyOps`
withdrawn in memory would contradict the run, which is the defect this decision exists to remove.

**6. Monotonicity is inherited, not re-implemented.** The rule reads `Revoked`, which no
`Controls.step` arm shrinks, so a withdrawn op performer is reported withdrawn on every prefix of the
stream after the revoke, a `Resume` included; the tests assert it prefix by prefix. With the op
performer not revoked, coverage is the registry-only formula, compared capability by capability under
an empty stream, a host revoke, a suspend and a throttle of `ApplyOps`, for both performances.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** It forecloses reporting the op performer's withdrawal
as an absence without a change to `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`; item 2 names the trigger. It leaves the
uncontrolled host coverage (`ServerSession`, read off the registry with no controls) as it was — with
no controls there is nothing withdrawn to report. No wire member, fixture byte, demanded-document
byte, control-stream byte or proof statement moves.

## D29 — `Each` over a literal collection is vocabulary that lowers to the core by SUBSTITUTION, on both axes; the substitution is the witness's and the fold runs the sequence; a placeholder is bound lexically by one `Each` and refused at validation; the specification does not move (2026-10-02)

**2026-10-02. Phase 1990. Fulfils the per-element case D1 and D2 charter and D21 could not express;
the first of three phases on per-element iteration (1991 extends the collection to one the store
holds, 1992 is the grid-shaped witness that exercises both). Under D14: `proofs/BoundedFold.fst`,
`proofs/Staging.fst`, `proofs/Undo.fst` and `proofs/EffectGate.fst` were restated and re-proved
before a `.fs` moved. Amends K2 of `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.7 a third time.**

D21 gave the core `Repeat(bound, body)` and deliberately gave its body no index: an index the body
could overwrite would not be a function of the bound alone, which running the inverse the same number
of times rests on. The consequence is that a loop whose body depends on WHICH iteration it is in
cannot be written. The first domain to need one is a spreadsheet's automation, whose importer resolves
`For i = 2 To 100: Cells(i, 3)` into a fixed array of cell identities; today that array can only be
run unrolled — one copy of the body per element, total, and growing the wire with the data. This
entry adds `Each(collection, placeholder, body)`, where the collection is a LITERAL list in the tree
and the body reads the current element through a placeholder, and records what the model argued for.

**1. The shape, on both axes, mirrored.** `ActionView` gains `Each of collection: JVal list *
placeholder: string * body: 'Action`; `OpView<'Op>` gains `Each of collection: JVal list *
placeholder: string * body: 'Op list`. Mirrored rather than shared, as D21 item 1 mirrored `Choose`
and `Repeat`, because what the placeholder stands in differs per axis: on the dispatch axis an
EXPRESSION of the domain's that reads the placeholder by name, resolved like any expression once the
element has been written over it; on the state axis an OPERAND of the domain's op — a path, a target,
an address. The collection is a list of `JVal`, the one value vocabulary the core owns, and a literal:
its length is the bound, fixed by the tree (D2), and no store is consulted to read it.

**2. It lowers by substitution, and the SUBSTITUTION IS THE WITNESS'S.** D1 says richer control
structure is vocabulary that lowers to the core, never a second evaluator. The core cannot see
inside an action or an op — that is the whole of D18 — so it cannot write an element over a
placeholder in one. What it can do is ask: `ActionWitness.Substitute: string -> JVal -> 'Action ->
'Action` and `StateWitness.Substitute: string -> JVal -> 'Op -> 'Op` are the two new arrows, each the
domain's own recursion over its own type, and each is called ONLY when an `Each` is met — a domain
with none fills them with the identity (the UI adapter does, and the toy's one op). The fold lowers
an `Each` to the body with each element substituted, in collection order, and folds the results as
it folds a `Sequence`'s members: the store threaded, the lists concatenated, the first halt the whole
answer. The handler plans an op-channel `Each` the same way, element by element. There is no new
evaluator, no new channel to state and no new case for anything downstream to price: the budget sums
the lowered elements' costs (no step for a bound, because a literal collection is not read), the
demanded projection and the replay classification read the lowered form, `OpView.beneath` lists the
substituted ops so the argument policy sees every address a placeholder stands for, the undo defects
read the substituted ops' classes (which the unsubstituted body cannot show — a publish to `{t}` is
compensable for one element and one-way for another), the trace records the elements that ran under
`Trace.Each` so a reader sees how many (`FlowDecision.Iterated`), and the inverse of an `Each` run
is the SEQUENCE of its elements' inverses in reverse order — each element overwrote different values,
exactly as D21 said of a repeat's iterations. Reversal is inherited, not re-proved.

**3. What the model owns, and what the witness does.** The model's `VEach act elements` and `OEach
elements` carry the elements ALREADY LOWERED — the body once per element, substituted — because the
model's action and op types are abstract and substitution into them is not a thing the model can
define; the witness's `View`, applied to exhaustion, is where the element meets the body, exactly as
it is where an action meets its shape. Over that view `each_is_lowering` (`BoundedFold.fst`) is an
EQUATION: an `Each` folds to the same outcome and placement as the sequence of its elements, traces
the same steps under its own constructor, is in the reversible fragment exactly when the sequence is,
and is priced as the sequence is; `each_reverse_is_sequence_reverse` says its inverse is the
sequence's; on the op axis `each_plans_as_lowered` (`Staging.fst`) says it plans as its elements
concatenated. Every existing theorem — totality, blindness, the reserved-key invariant, the halting
clause, `traced_agrees`, `reverse_run`, `fold_steps_within_cost`, the staging, gate and undo ladders
— extends over the shape as over a sequence, with no new lemma beyond the mechanical `_each` cases
that mirror the `_repeat` ones. **The obligation this leaves on the witness, stated rather than
assumed away:** `Substitute` preserves the body's SHAPE — the substituted action or op views as the
original does, with the placeholder replaced in every operand and nothing else moved; a nested `Each`
keeps its own collection and placeholder. It sits beside the obligation that `View` unfolds finitely,
and it is TESTED where the model cannot prove it: the differential hosts hand the model the elements
substituted through the production `Substitute` and run production, which substitutes as it folds,
beside it, over a toy corpus that covers an empty collection, one element, several, a halt inside an
element, nested iterations with distinct placeholders, and an `Each` inside the other two flow shapes;
a `Substitute` that moved the shape would show as a divergence there. A property the ladder also
records: on a tree containing no `Each` the lowering is never invoked — a witness whose `Substitute`
throws runs the Each-free corpus to the same answers through every walk.

**4. The element cannot be overwritten, so the case D21 refused an index for does not arise.** The
element is a value in the TREE — written over the placeholder before the body runs — and not a cell
in the store the body writes. A body that assigns to a key cannot change what the placeholder stood
for in its own or any later element; the inverse runs the elements' inverses in reverse order against
exactly the elements the forward run saw, because the elements are the collection's, fixed by the
tree. This is what D21's reversal argument required of an index and could not have from one.

**5. The binding rule, and where it is enforced.** An `Each` binds exactly ONE placeholder,
LEXICALLY, over its body. An `Each` nested inside another names its OWN placeholder, and a name an
enclosing `Each` already binds is REFUSED rather than shadowed — so no body ever reads a placeholder
two binders could mean, and the substitution order of nested lowerings (the inner lowered first, the
outer written over the result) can never change what an element stands for. A body that reads a
placeholder no enclosing `Each` binds is refused. Both are decided from the TREE alone: the core walks
the view with the set of bound names, and asks the witness only which placeholders a node's OWN
operands read (`ActionWitness.Placeholders`, `StateWitness.Placeholders` — the two other new arrows;
`[]` for a domain with none). The refusal is at VALIDATION, never at run time: `BoundedActions.run`
and `runTraced` refuse an ill-scoped program at entry, before its first step, as a halt naming the
placeholder with nothing run, written or emitted; `Handler.planOps` refuses an `ApplyOps` effect
before its first op plans, naming the placeholder as the arm's `Failed`. The static walks are public
(`BoundedActions.scopeDefects`, `StateWitness.scopeDefects`) so a host that validates a program at
registration reads the same answer. The run-time fallback — a placeholder reaching a resolver
unsubstituted — is a domain error the scope check exists to make unreachable, and the toy's resolver
says so if it ever is. Not modelled: the model's expressions and ops are abstract and read no names;
the ladder carries the refusal as tested.

**6. The specification does NOT move, and the phase's wire task is answered rather than performed.**
The phase as filed asked for `ProgramWire` and `HandlerWire` to encode `Each`, with the
specification's normative text, schemas, emitter, manifest and new fixtures in the same change-set.
Checked against `docs/generic-tier.md` §6: the program wire specification never spells a shape of the
action algebra — its §3 names the action and op vocabularies as referenced, "specified elsewhere", and
its rule 2 forbids restating their cases; a compute stage's `action` and an `ApplyOps` effect's ops are
carried by the DOMAIN's own codec (`ActionWitness.Encode`, `Stream.Encode`), spliced verbatim (K6).
`Choose` and `Repeat` moved no wire member for the same reason (D21: "no wire member moved"), and so
`Each` moves none: where the wire carries an `Each` compactly, it is the domain's codec that carries it
— the toy's and the verb's test codecs gain a case and round-trip it; the UI adapter's codec is the UI
specification's and the UI tier adopts no `Each`. `ProgramWire`'s one touch is the replay
classification, which is a walk over the view and not an encoding. No schema, fixture byte, refusal
class or rule of the specification moves, the five-artefact forward coupling is not engaged, and the
codec families and the driver scenarios pass byte for byte. A refusal class for the scope defect was
weighed — it would make the scope check a decode-time refusal across the specification's vocabulary —
and declined as a specification act this phase has no need of: the refusal lands at the fold's entry
and the handler's plan, through vocabularies that exist.

**7. D14 applied a sixth time, and what the restatement found.** The model's `VEach` and `OEach`
fold, trace, plan and walk as a sequence does — their cases in every lemma call the list lemma that
already exists — so termination stays structural (an element is a subterm of the list of elements)
and the four modules re-check in their usual time with no change to any `decreases` clause and no new
proof technique. The finding worth recording is the one that shaped item 3: a model that substituted
itself — a witness whose `w_resolve` pre-substitutes, or a syntactic `subst` over the view — was
designed first and set aside. Both need the fold's `VEach` case to recurse into a term that is not a
subterm (the substituted body), which costs either a size measure on every lemma in the module or a
commutation law for nested placeholders stated as a hypothesis; and both put into the model a
substitution the model's abstract `e` and `a` cannot define, so the obligation on the witness would
have been the same law under a longer proof. Carrying the lowered elements in the view puts the
obligation where D18 already puts `View`'s, and leaves the proofs saying exactly what they say.

**Version.** Rides the `0.7.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking,
and this is breaking of the same class — a case on `ActionView` and on `OpView<'Op>`, two members on
`ActionWitness` and two on `StateWitness`, a case on `Trace` and on `FlowDecision`, and
`OpView.beneath` taking the substitution. No wire member, fixture byte or demanded-document byte
moves for any program that uses no `Each`; the demanded document stays at version 6. `STABILITY.md`
has the consumer's account and `docs/migrations/phase-1990.md` the diff.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** The collection is LITERAL: a collection the store
holds — a region's extent read once, recorded in the trace, replayed from the record — is Phase 1991's,
under the operator's four conditions, and nothing here presumes its shape. A placeholder stands for a
VALUE: a placeholder in a key of the dispatch axis's store (`Assign`'s key is a string the view
carries) is not expressible, by design — on that axis an address-dependent write is a leaf or an op,
and the op axis carries it. Shadowing is refused rather than defined; a later need for it is a change
to item 5, with the substitution order then load-bearing. The UI adapter adopts neither shape; a UI
handler that would genuinely benefit lands as a finding against `ui_view_no_flow`'s test.

## D30 — Program certifies its wire format over a non-UI witness: the toy is a specification subject with a scenario family of its own, a second obligation lets a trace record a handler run, and a family selection says which families a run certifies (2026-10-03)

**2026-10-03. fuaran#2011, the first of the phases that move the UI adapters out of this repository
(fuaran#2012 moved them: D32). Specification side: `PROGRAM_WIRE.md` §10.6, the four `toy-*` schemas, the
`driver-semantics-toy` scenarios and the checker's toy branch. No package moves: everything on this
side is in `tests/`, so `STABILITY.md` is untouched and no version advances.**

Until this phase Program could certify its own wire format only through the UI witness. The
specification's `driver-semantics` family records UI trees; the parity suite, the Fable leg, the
server suite and the proof host's corpus all ran them through UI-tier types. Moving the adapters
would have taken half of this repository's conformance evidence with them, and left a gate that
could not go green on its own format.

**1. The toy witness is a specification subject, and its vocabulary is OWNED there.** The toy of
D18 (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Tests/ToyDomain.fs`) fills all three axes and names every shape the fold
distinguishes, so it is the witness the specification now states in full: a tree (node, label
expression, handlers by event, children), the nine actions and five expressions, the `Relabel` op,
the state and the `Sound` effect (§10.6). Unlike the UI tree it is not a referenced vocabulary, so
the specification's §2 governs it without exception, a scenario's `tree.json` is its canonical
bytes, and a recorded tree is compared as an owned document — decoded, re-encoded, compared. The
effect alone adopts §5.2's envelope (a `kind` discriminator, the emitter's member order), because a
trace compares effects as emitted.

**2. The wire codec is written BESIDE the witness, not into it.** `ToyWire.fs` encodes and decodes
every toy document; the witness's own `Encode` members are left exactly as they were. Those members
are what the core hashes and the replay classification reads — an action's canonical form names only
what that classification needs — and widening them would have moved digests the genericity suite and
the proof hosts pin, for a reason that has nothing to do with either. Two encoders of one action is
the cost, and it is bounded: the op's two spellings are pinned equal by a test, and the action's are
two different documents for two different readers. A decoded `Ring` carries a closure that FAILS if
invoked, so a fold that recovered behaviour from the slot would be caught rather than read as inert.

**3. A trace can now record a handler run, through a second OBLIGATION rather than a new shape.**
The shard listed the argument-policy gate, staged perform and the op channel among the vocabulary the
family covers. Checked against the corpus, the premise did not hold for the UI family it named as the
model: no UI scenario records a handler run — the server suite registers a handler against
`server-handler-call` and asserts the outcome in F#, so that reading was never in the corpus. Nor
does the UI family reach `Choose`, `Repeat`, `Each` or `Require`: the UI witness views no action as
any of them. So the toy family covers the listed vocabulary by adding what was missing rather than
by mirroring the UI family. §10.2 already records the obligation a scenario presumes "so that a
scenario presuming something else enumerates rather than renumbers"; this phase is the first to use
that, with `handler-loop`. A handler-loop scenario names its handlers as `hostHandlers` — named,
never carried, on §10.3's reasoning about policies — and §10.6 registers one set, `toy-relabel`,
whose three handlers pin the op channel committing an edit, the argument policy refusing a plan, and
a staged host call declining after a complete plan. A placement with no handler registry is out of
scope for those scenarios, and the client legs say so by name.

**4. The legs.** The conformance leg is `ToyFamilyTests.fs` in `Fuaran.Program.Tests`, which
references no UI-tier package (`CoreBoundaryTests` names the harness files and reads the project's
declared, resolved and built references): every scenario at the client placement and at the generic
`ServerSession` under the handler set it names, the no-handler server reading against the client,
the count, and a mutated trace going red at the first step it touches. The Fable leg compiles the
same shared runner (`ToyScenarios.fs`) to JavaScript. The proof host folds every scripted action of
every toy scenario through the extraction and the ported core (`proofs.json`,
`toy-family-model-agrees-with-shipped-code`); a handler-loop scenario's call is compared unanswered
there, since answering it is the staging oracle's subject. Each leg prints the family's scenario
count. The seeds that generate the corpus are `ToySeeds.fs`, emitted by
`Fuaran.Program.Tests --emit-toy-scenarios`, which records a trace only when every placement in
scope agrees, and a test holds the corpus and the seeds equal.

**5. A family selection, and a record of who certifies what.** `FUARAN_PROGRAM_FAMILIES` (or
`run.ps1 -Families`) selects the families a run certifies; an undeclared name fails the run. Every
suite that reads a family consults it and skips a deselected family by name — except the server
suite, whose two UI-family legs read the parity loader unconditionally and are UI-typed, so they
left with the adapters in fuaran#2012 (D32). That exception is RECORDED, not hidden: `ToyFamilyTests`
holds the table of which families each suite certifies and which suite ignores the selection, and
checks both against the suites' own sources, so a suite that starts or stops reading a family, or
consulting the selection, without the table saying so goes red. On a toy-alone run the gate is green,
the parity suite, the proof host's UI corpus and the Fable leg's UI half skip by name, and the server
suite still exercises the UI family — which is the one sense in which "the toy family alone" is not
yet the whole gate, and the one fuaran#2012 closed (D32: the server suite left, and the table's
exception with it). (Amended by D31, fuaran#2017: those legs, and the
proof hosts and codec certification beside them, are no longer the only certification of anything this
repository keeps — the core's evidence is re-hosted at the toy witness, so what fuaran#2012 moved is the
UI adapter's own evidence and nothing Program must keep.)

**6. The UI family's loader reads its own family only.** `FixtureIo.scenarios` and the Fable leg's
`loadScenarios` took every manifest scenario; with a second family in the manifest they would have
handed a toy tree to the UI decoder. Both now filter by family, which is also what lets the server
suite stay unedited here.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** It does not make the toy a product or a second
implementation of the loop (§11.3's deferral stands: one host still records both families). It does
not specify the toy's `exit` assertion, which no scenario exercises, nor a host policy for the toy,
whose one effect names no destination. The UI family is untouched, byte for byte, and moves to the UI
tier's repository with the adapters.

## D31 — The core's proof differentials and its codec certification are re-hosted at the toy witness, in the project that reaches no UI type; what stays behind the UI tier is evidence ABOUT the UI tier (2026-10-03)

**2026-10-03. fuaran#2017, between fuaran#2011 and fuaran#2012. Specification side: `PROGRAM_WIRE.md`
§10.7, four `toy-*` vector families with a `subject` member, `vocabularyFreeDocuments` in the manifest,
and toy models in all three emitters. No package moves and no `src/` file changes: everything on this
side is in `tests/`, `proofs.json` and `proofs/check.ps1`, so `STABILITY.md` is untouched and no
version advances. No `.fst` model and no proved statement changed.**

**Why.** fuaran#2012 was dispatched to move the UI adapters and their suites out, and stopped before
moving anything: eleven of the ladder's twelve tested claims, and the only certification of
`ProgramWire`/`HandlerWire` against the specification's vectors, were hosted in suites that reach the UI
tier. Their hosts compile `proofs/oracle`, which is not a package; moved, they would have left the core
uncompared with its models on any gate of its own, with both gates green (re-homing D7). The guard it
landed (`CoreBoundaryTests`, `uiHostedEvidence`) is what this decision shrinks.

**1. Every differential about the CORE runs at the toy witness, in `Fuaran.Program.Tests`.** That
project now references the oracle project (FSharp.Core-only, unpacked). New hosts, each a port of its
UI original with at least its case count and every go-red case kept:
`ToyStagingOracleTests.fs` (staging 8, effect gate 12 — including the op-contract wrapper and the keyed
handler host with its durable reading — and undo 6), `ToyDurableReplayTests.fs` (durable replay 13),
`ToyBoundedFoldOracleTests.fs` (the generic fold with the flow-shape, each and toy-family claims, 7).
The toy's apply is total and its witness has no guard, so the hosts COMPOSE what the UI corpus reached:
a strict apply refusing a relabel of an absent node, a view making check relabels `Require`, an `Undo`
classing them one-way and one relabel a declared compensation. The toy witness itself is unchanged —
its `Encode` shapes are digests other tests pin. Each claim in `proofs.json` names its toy host; the
UI copies ran where they were until fuaran#2012 moved them (D32), and were no longer any claim's host.

**2. The proof leg runs several hosts per module.** `proofs/check.ps1` gives each module a list of
hosts, the toy host first; a module whose model also describes UI-adapter code keeps its UI host
second, and that entry leaves with the adapters.

**3. The codec is certified at a second subject the specification owns.** The vectors in the UI
vocabulary stay exactly as they were. The specification adds toy-subject vectors for every codec path
the UI vectors cover that the toy can reach — handler, server effect, the toy's one client effect, and
outcome — with their derived replay classification, reproduced by all three emitters; invocation and
logic-tree-ref documents carry no vocabulary and are certified by a host of either subject as they
stand. `ToyWireConformanceTests.fs` certifies the GENERIC codecs at a toy witness composed with the
toy's wire codec (`ToyWire`), with the same five properties as the UI host; the UI host now certifies
the vectors with no `subject`, and checks that the two subjects partition the manifest.

**4. What stays behind the UI tier, and why it may.** `uiHostedEvidence` is now the bounded fold over
the UI witness's fourteen arms, the budget's UI weighing and the UI BoundedDriver's G2 gate, and the
UI-typed codec certification — evidence about the UI adapter's code, which leaves with it. The core's
half of the budget claim is a new tested claim, `budget-generic-model-agrees-at-the-toy-witness`. A new
boundary test moves a re-hosted claim back onto a UI-reaching suite, directly and through a project
reference, and requires the guard to see it.

**Findings recorded, not fixed here.**
- **The budget model has no flow shapes.** `Budget.fst`'s `act` is `ALeaf | AChain`, so the model prices
  `Choose`, `Repeat` and `Each` as leaves, while `Budget.actionCascadeCost` prices them by their arms,
  bounds and elements. Invisible at the UI witness (no UI action views as a flow shape); real at the
  core. A named case in the toy budget host holds it and goes red when the model gains the shapes.
  Closing it is a model change.
- **§9.5's refusal is keyed on the referenced vocabulary.** `ProgramWire.refuseResultTarget` refuses a
  `Call` carrying `into`; a toy handler whose `Ring` is `targeted` decodes and is refused only by the
  fold (§10.6). The specification records that no toy vector pins the codec's reading; deciding it needs
  either a witness-level rule in the codec or a ruling in the text.
- **The text names no refusal class for a `Sound` with an extra member.** `ToyWire.decodeEffect`
  answers `missing-member`; §5.2's arms answer `undeclared-member`. §10.7 records it as open; no vector
  pins it.
- **A count in the ladder was wrong.** `flow-shapes-model-agrees-with-shipped-code` said nineteen flow
  cases; the corpus carries eighteen, now asserted by label.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** It does not move anything out of the repository; that is
fuaran#2012's, and its precondition is now met for the core's evidence. The UI-witness claims above
still compile `proofs/oracle`, so moving their hosts is a decision fuaran#2012 has to take about the
UI half of the models; this decision does not take it. (fuaran#2012 took it, D32: the two claims moved
with the adapters, over byte copies of the models and their extractions, and this repository's leg still
checks the models.)

## D32 — The UI adapters live in the UI tier's repository, which depends on this core's released packages; this repository pins, declares and names no UI-tier package; supersedes `docs/generic-tier.md` §4's option A (2026-10-04)

**2026-10-04. fuaran#2012, after fuaran#2011 (D30) and fuaran#2017 (D31). Supersedes the ratification of
option A recorded in `docs/generic-tier.md` §4 (2026-09-27). Breaking for this repository's package set:
two packages leave it. The four core packages are unchanged and keep 0.7.1.**

**What moved.** `Fuaran.Program.UI` and `Fuaran.Program.Server.UI` — the UI witness, the pre-0.6.0
aliases over the generic core, the UI transport loop and the server placement's UI instantiation —
moved to the UI tier's repository, file for file, under the same package ids (re-homing D6). So did
every suite that was UI-typed: the bounded, runtime, server and parity suites, the parity project, the
RunQuery benchmark, the UI-vocabulary family's Fable leg and the `client-program` sample. They take
that repository's lockstep version from their first release there, so the version line jumps from
0.7.1 to that tier's; 0.7.1 is the last version of either published from this repository. They consume
this core by PACKAGE, at its released 0.7.1, and never by project reference.

**Why the dependency now runs this way.** D5 put the adapter here because a UI package referencing a
Program that carried UI types reproduced its version-skew class. D18 removed the UI types from the
core, so a UI-tier package depending on this core depends on a core that contains none of them: there
is no cycle and no skew class left for option A to avoid. What option B's "against" column named —
the UI-typed suites and the UI-tree scenarios leaving the repository that owned the behaviour — was
answered before the move rather than by it: D30 made the toy a specification subject and D31
re-hosted every differential and the codec certification that is about the CORE at the toy witness,
so nothing this repository keeps is certified only through the UI tier. What left is evidence ABOUT
the UI adapter, and it now runs beside the adapter.

**The rule, enforced.** This repository pins no `Fuaran.UI.*` package, and no project in it declares
one or one of the two adapter ids. `CoreBoundaryTests` reads the central package file and EVERY
project file in the tree and fails on either; it was made to fail once with a pin added to
`Directory.Packages.props` and once with a reference added to a project, then reverted. The probes
that used to be shown red on the adapter are now shown red on synthetic inputs, because the one real
subject that referenced the tier has left.

**The evidence, and where each piece lives now.**

1. **No evidence this repository claims is certified only through the UI tier.** `uiHostedEvidence`
   is EMPTY and the guard asserts it stays empty; it is still shown able to go red, over two synthetic
   suites — one declaring a UI-tier reference, one reaching it only through a project reference —
   to which a claim's host is pointed.
2. **The two claims ABOUT the adapter moved with it** (`model-agrees-with-shipped-code`,
   `budget-model-agrees-with-shipped-code`). Their rows stay on this ladder as pointers, carrying the
   ladder's `repo` field and that repository's paths, not deleted. The UI tier's repository holds
   byte copies of `proofs/BoundedFold.fst`, `proofs/Budget.fst` and their extractions, declared in its
   `copies.json` with this repository's files as canonical, re-checks the copied models on the same
   pin, byte-diffs their extractions and runs the two differentials, case for case. This repository's
   proof leg still checks every model and byte-diffs every extraction; its hosts are the toy-witness
   lists alone.
3. **The UI-vocabulary wire vectors** are certified there by the server UI suite; this repository
   certifies the codec against the toy-subject vectors (D31).
4. **The demanded corpus stays here**, beside the codec that is its authority. Two of its vectors are
   real harvests of a UI program, so its EMITTER moved with the server UI suite, which writes a byte
   copy (declared in that repository's `copies.json`, canonical here) and compares its emission with
   it. Here, `DemandedCorpusReadTests` re-derives every vector's recorded reading from this
   repository's own `Demanded.decode` with no UI type in reach, so a codec change that moves a reading
   is red here first. The corpus's `generator` member names the emitter's new home.
5. **Three structural guards stayed.** The scans of `src/Fuaran.Program.Server` and
   `src/Fuaran.Program.Bounded` that lived in the server suite (no second stage fold, no engine named
   on the durable contract surface, no second evaluator) are about THIS repository's sources, so they
   were re-homed verbatim to `CoreSourceGuardTests`.

**What it costs, stated.** A change to the core that an adapter must follow is now a release here and
a pin raise there — the cross-repository ordering option B's "against" column named. That is the
normal posture of a substrate and its consumers, and it is what the rest of the re-homing plan needs:
this repository's core moves to a neutral substrate organisation next, and could not while it pinned a
UI tier. The Trusted Publishing policy for the two ids on the UI tier's repository is an operator act
on the registry, recorded in the phase's outcome rather than here.

## D33 — The substrate neutrality sweep: the tree names no private project, product, repository or workspace artefact, and the history finding is recorded rather than rewritten (2026-10-04)

**2026-10-04. fuaran#2013.** This repository is moving to a neutral substrate organisation, and a
repository there references neither of the organisations it serves' private content. Program grew up
in one of them and then served the other, so before the move its tree and its history were swept
against that rule. This entry records the sweep so that it can be re-run, what it changed, and what it
deliberately left.

**The pattern set.** One case-insensitive extended regular expression in five classes: (1) private
repository, product and organisation-internal names; (2) the maintainers' planning-command names and
their workspace tooling and script names; (3) workspace instruction and planning-document file names;
(4) framing that implies a private ecosystem around this repository, and the vocabulary of the
coordination layer that consumes it; (5) the planning engine's name anywhere but a bare citation. An
allow-list admits the copyright line and `NOTICE`'s attribution; bare phase citations
(`roadmap-engine#703`, `fuaran#1967`, `Phase 1967`); the specification repository's current
organisation slug where a workflow locates it, which the re-home retires; this repository's own pack
script naming itself; the Unicode term "Basic Multilingual Plane"; and the workflow comment stating the
specification's present visibility, which its public flip retires. The literal set names the private
things it looks for, so it cannot be published in a file whose claim is that it names none. It is held
on the maintainers' private side as a two-line file (the pattern, then the allow-list, each
LF-terminated) whose SHA-256 is
`e94be5417fdfb713d2d2ea99e22c90227b99d78c99f23fe1194e1dbac836f193`, and it re-runs from the repository
root as:

```powershell
$banned, $allowed = Get-Content <the recorded pattern file>
git grep -n -I -i -E $banned | Select-String -NotMatch -Pattern $allowed
```

An empty result is the pass. The history form is the same pattern over every commit's added lines
(`git log --all -p`) and over every message (`git log --all --format=%B`).

**What the tree sweep changed.** No behaviour moved; every change is prose or a test message.
- **D24 and D25.** D24 explained the both-ways reach obligation by the planned use of the instantiation
  that performs ops, naming the layer it belongs to; it now says "a second instantiation that performs
  ops", with `roadmap-engine#703` kept. D25 said its three gaps were generic "rather than" that layer's
  vocabulary; it now says rather than that domain's own. The re-homing plan expected the citation in
  D19 and D25; D19 cites nothing private, and the second one sat in D24.
- **D11** described the structured-document domain's parent folder in workspace terms; it now says its
  parent directory. D11's unnamed statement of where the evaluation suite lives stays: it names
  nothing, and it is the boundary's reasoning.
- **`proofs/README.md`** cited a consumer's trust-ledger plan by name, twice; it is now "a consumer's
  trust ledger".
- **`docs/performer-boundary.md`** named the host SDK and gave a path into a private planning tree for
  the escape-hatch inventory; it now says "a host SDK" and "the UI tier's escape-hatch inventory",
  with `fuaran#900` kept.
- **The verb witness.** `VerbDomain.fs` names nothing specific to the layer that consumes it. Its
  tests' comments and two assertion messages called the file the verb moves a "shard", a planning
  word; they now call it a note, which is what its path (`notes/x.md`) already said.

**Deliberately not swept.** Generic nouns that name no artefact: "workspace", "estate", "vertical",
"operator", "driver" and "dispatch" (both program vocabulary), and "shard" where a decision cites the
plan a phase was written against. The public repositories this tier cites — the UI tier's
`fuaran-dotnet`, `fuaran-core`'s proof kit — and the local folder-feed convention are public, so
citing them is not a reference to private content. Revisit any of these when an outside reader is
misled by one.

**History.** 135 commits on every ref. Added lines: 14 in 9 commits (`2554a4f` 4, `aa8f9c6` 3, and
one each in `f6a4a34`, `dd85868`, `cbeded1`, `54a4333`, `5042dbf`, `3c2a07b`, `2c73705`). Messages: 10
lines in 5 commits (`607515f` 4, `f6a4a34` 2, `cbeded1` 2, `e7e1156`, `e7c58f8`). Most are the
bootstrap-era instruction file and pack-script header that `607515f` removed at the public flip, and
the citations this entry rewords. This repository is already public, so its history is not rewritten
here: the finding is recorded, and any remedy is the maintainers' act, not this repository's.

## D34 — `RunQuery` gains a generic evaluator seam: the host's evaluator receives the source, the pipeline and the named-source resolver together, beside the host functions on the effect registry; the in-memory fold is the absent case and the reference; a host that cannot declare its evaluator a pure read is staged like a host call (2026-10-08)

**2026-10-08. Phase 1905.** `ServerEffect.RunQuery` carries a `DataSource` and a `Transform list`
behind the gate and the argument policy, but until this entry its evaluation was fixed: the handler
resolved the source BY NAME into a whole table and folded the pipeline in memory. A host that could
answer the pipeline more cheaply (from a database, a file with predicate pushdown, a remote service)
was handed the name and never the pipeline, so it had to materialise everything. D18 kept that shape
deliberately; this entry adds the one seam D18 left out, and adds it generically. Nothing in it says
what the host does.

**Where the seam lives: on `ServerEffectRegistry`, beside `HostFunctions`, not on `ProgramWitness`.**
D18's witness parameterises a DOMAIN: its tree, its actions, its store, its ops. The query's types are
not the domain's. `DataSource`, `Transform` and `Table` are the substrate's, the same for every
witness, so a witness member would be generic in nothing. And an evaluator is not a property of a
domain: two hosts of the same domain can answer the same query from different places. It is a host
act, like registering a performer, and the registry is where this placement keeps host acts that sit
behind the gate. Placing it there also means every interpreter that takes a registry, direct and
durable, reaches it without a signature change, and the gate and the argument policy decide before it
is ever asked: a refused capability never reaches an evaluator.

**The signature is `source -> pipeline -> resolver -> Result<Table, QueryFault>`, synchronous.** The
phase was written against `Deferred<Result<Table, _>>`. Checked against the tree, that premise does
not hold here. Every host seam of this placement is a synchronous `Result`: the host functions, the
op performer, and the named-source resolver the fold already used. The handler is a two-phase fold
that decides before it performs, so it has no point at which a pending answer could be awaited. A
`Pending` could only become a halt, and a host can say that with an `Error`. The substrate's
`Deferred` also lives in a package this repository does not reference. The "bound environment" is the
named-source resolver (`ServerServices.Sources`), the only environment the fold resolves against. A
host that needs an asynchronous evaluator blocks inside it, exactly as a host function does today.

**Absent is the fold, byte for byte.** `ServerEffectRegistry.denyAll` carries `QueryEvaluator =
None`, and `None` runs `QueryEvaluator.inMemory`, which is today's evaluation moved, with the same
halt reasons (`QueryFault.describe` on an `Eval` fault is the discriminator the handler always
reported). No codec moved, and the program wire specification and its corpus do not change. The
existing suites run unchanged against the absent case.

**The static query-schema checks run unchanged; a host answer they refute halts, naming both.** The
seam changes where a table comes from, not what shape it has. `QueryEvaluator.checkedAgainst`
composes the walk the pre-execution check already runs (`Schema.ofPipeline` over the host's declared
`SourceSchemas`) onto the evaluator's answer. A disagreement is `QueryFault.SchemaMismatch`, whose
halt reason is `query-schema-mismatch: expected <derived>, answered <answered>`. Both renderings name
only columns and types, which come from the host's own declarations and the host's own answer, never
a row. A derived column must be answered, with its derived type where one is stated, and a closed
derivation admits no column it does not name. Column ORDER is not compared, because readers address
columns by name. The server placement composes the check through `ServerServices.effects`, which is
the registry both the direct and the durable arm now take. With no evaluator it changes nothing,
since the fold is the reference the derivation is checked against, not something to check. A
pure-read answer that is refuted halts while planning (`Failed`); a staged one halts while performing
(`PerformFailed`).

**Staged is the default. Unstaged and `Idempotent` only where the host declares a pure read.**
`QueryEvaluator.reaching` (staged) and `QueryEvaluator.pureRead` are the two constructors, and the
posture is the host's declaration, which nothing here checks. A pure read keeps today's placement: it
is evaluated while planning, recomputed on replay, and repeats freely. A host that cannot say its
evaluator is a pure read gets D8's answer for anything that may reach outside, the same as a
`HostCall`: the query is admitted while planning, asked only after the plan completes (so a halted
plan asked nothing), its table lands then, and the run's trail records `Reached` (one-way for undo).
The default is staged because staging fails closed. A host that wrongly declares a pure read can
re-run a side effect; a host that wrongly leaves an evaluator staged pays only placement. The
durability doctrine prefers that trade, and it is the same reason every other default here is closed.

**What a staged query costs, stated.** Its table lands after the plan, so a `Compute` stage later in
the same handler does not see it. `HostCall` with `into` already behaves this way. The durable
interpreter journals the staged answer at its ordinal under capability `RunQuery`, with the table in
the column codec's canonical form (`QueryEvaluator.through`), and a replay serves it without asking
again. The repeat facet is declared with `DurableServices.declaringQueryEvaluator`, and
`NonIdempotent` is the default for an undeclared facet, on `facetOf`'s terms. Unlike the op
performer's registration, the evaluator's registration is not visible to the facet derivation (it is
on the registry, which the derivation is not given). So the DECLARATION is what tells the derivation
that `RunQuery` reaches outside, and `Facets.undeclaredQueryEvaluator` is the check that catches a
staged evaluator the facets were not told about.

**What this entry does not reach, recorded rather than papered over.** Two published STATIC postures
read only the handler's declared form, which names no evaluator: the demanded projection's replay
reasons (`HandlerWire.replayReasons`) and its undo posture (`Undo.postureOf`). So for a host with a
staged evaluator they say what they have always said about a `RunQuery`, which is a read. The runtime
fails closed in both places: the undo run refuses at the `Reached` step (`OneWayStep`, naming
`RunQuery`), and the durable interpreter journals the step. Making the static postures say it would
need a new defect tag in the demanded document, and that is a wire change this phase is bound not to
make. It is left to a successor that can move the specification.

**The law family is what a host runs to certify its own evaluator.** `QueryEvaluatorLaws.certify`
takes an evaluator and the fixtures the host declares. Each fixture is a source, a pipeline, and the
named tables both evaluators resolve against. On every fixture the evaluator must answer what the
fold answers: the same table, byte for byte in the column codec's canonical form, rows in the fold's
order (a reader may depend on it), or a fault with the same halt reason. Each disagreement is reported
with the fixture's name and both answers. The fold passes trivially, and a filter pushed down to the
source passes because it answers the same table. The family certifies agreement on the declared
fixtures and nothing beyond them. The posture declaration is likewise the host's claim and is not
tested.

**What the seam does not claim.** Anything about what the host's evaluator does: where it reads, what
else it touches, or how it arrives at the table. What crosses is a source and a pipeline (with the
resolver). What mediates is the gate, the argument policy, the schema check on the answer, and, under
the default posture, D8's staging. The core still references no database or any other domain: the
boundary test now refuses every `Fuaran.*` name outside the substrate and this domain's own packages,
written as the complement of what is allowed so that a domain nobody has named yet is refused too.
The suite `QueryEvaluatorTests` pins the rest of this entry at the toy witness.

**Version.** `0.8.0`, advancing from the tagged `0.7.1`. `ServerEffectRegistry` and `PerformerFacets`
each gain a member, which is FS0764 on a full-literal construction and therefore breaking by
`STABILITY.md`'s own rule, even though everything else is additive.

## D35 — The budget model prices the three flow shapes as the shipped code does — a selection by its dearer arm, a repeat by the top of its bound, an iteration by its lowered elements, all saturating — and the code's rule is taken for every shape, none corrected (2026-10-08)

**2026-10-08. fuaran#2018.** `proofs/Budget.fst` was written against an `actionCascadeCost` that made
one distinction — is this a chain, and what does it hold — and summed with an unsaturated `+`. Phase
1976 gave the shipped function `Choose` and `Repeat` and made it saturate; Phase 1990 gave it `Each`.
The model did not move, so its `act` priced every flow shape as a leaf and its G2 theorem described
a gate over a figure the core no longer computed. fuaran#2017 recorded the gap (D31) and held it open
with a named case at the toy witness. This entry closes it, and records the decision the phase asked
for first: for each shape, is the code's rule the one the model takes, or is the code wrong?

**The rule the code computes, shape by shape, and the decision.**

- **`Choose(condition, whenTrue, whenFalse, exit)` → `satAdd 1 (max (cost whenTrue) (cost whenFalse))`.**
  One step for the condition, plus the DEARER arm; the exit expression is not priced. TAKEN. The price
  must bound the run whichever arm the condition picks, and the condition is read once; the exit is
  read only by the reversal, which runs as its own handler through the same gate (D22) and is priced
  there. Pricing both arms (the sum) would be a correct bound and a bad one — it would refuse a tree
  whose run can never cost that much — and pricing the cheaper arm is the defect the new go-red case
  commits. The model's `AChoose` carries the two arms and nothing else, because nothing else is read.
- **`Repeat(Literal n, body)` → `satAdd 1 (satMul (max n 0) (cost body))`.** One step for the bound,
  plus the body `n` times; a negative literal runs nothing and is priced as nothing but its step.
  TAKEN. It is the unrolling the fold performs (`repeat_is_unrolling`), and `max n 0` is the clause
  that keeps a negative count from pricing NEGATIVE — which would read as cheap — rather than a
  validation the price is standing in for. The model spells the clamp out (`clamp_nat`).
- **`Repeat(Parameter(count, lo, hi), body)` → `satAdd 1 (satMul (max hi 0) (cost body))`.** Priced
  at the TOP of the range, with the count expression never resolved and `lo` never read. TAKEN. The
  price is computed from the tree before the run and must need no store; the top of the range is
  the most the fold will run before it halts on an out-of-range count (`fold`'s `VRepeat` arm in `BoundedFold.fst`),
  so it is the least price that bounds every admitted run. The model's `BParameter` carries the
  range and drops the expression, which is the honest statement that the price cannot see it.
- **`Each(collection, placeholder, body)` → the lowered elements' costs summed, with no step for a
  bound.** TAKEN. An `Each` IS the sequence of its lowered elements (D29, `each_is_lowering`), and a
  sequence has no bound step because a literal collection is not read — an `Each` over nothing costs
  zero exactly as an empty sequence does. The model's `AEach` carries the lowered elements, as
  `BoundedFold.fst`'s `VEach` does: what the lowering IS belongs to the witness's `Substitute` and
  is that theorem's subject, and the model is exact over whatever the witness lowers by construction.
- **Saturation.** Every add and multiply above is `satAdd` / `satMul`. TAKEN, and the model's
  cascade now saturates under the same parameter `mx` the walk uses — which is the drift the shard
  did not name: the file's "NOT saturating, deliberately" was true of the function in Phase 1716 and
  false since 1976. Nothing in model or production is now unsaturated, and `proofs.json`'s
  `int32-bound-assumed` says so instead of the reverse.

No code changed. The shipped rules are the ones a reader would arrive at from the fold's own laws,
and each has a theorem behind it now rather than a comment.

**What is proved, and in whose terms.** The one theorem about the figure is `cascade_saturates_exact`:
the cascade cost of every shape the core accepts is the EXACT price — `view_cost`'s rule, restated
over the budget model's own `act` because the two models deliberately share no type (D31's
`resource-bounds` posture) — clipped at the bound. So the gate never reads a figure below the exact
one, which is what lets `fold_steps_within_cost`'s bound on a run carry across to the number the
gate compares, and a figure under the bound is the exact price, usable as a number. Beside it, one
law per flow shape stated for the gate's caller — what an ADMITTED price says of the parts that will
run: `choose_covers_either_arm` (either arm admitted under the cap less one), `repeat_literal_is_unrolling`
and `repeat_parameter_covers_every_count` (the unrolling is priced, and every count in the range is
covered), `each_is_elements` with `each_member_within` / `chain_member_within` (every element
admitted). Every per-shape law carries `cap < mx`, because a price AT the bound says only "at least
this much" — `InteractionBudget.unlimited`'s case, and nobody's gate.

**The model's `step` names the bound.** Since the cascade saturates, `step` and `breached` take the
saturation bound as their first argument. The UI tier's repository holds byte copies of this model
and its extraction (declared in its `copies.json` with these files as canonical, D32) and its host
calls `step`; the next re-copy carries the new signature and that host passes the bound it already
supplies for the walk. That is the declared copy mechanism working, not a coupling this entry adds.

**The host states the lowering rather than reading it.** The toy differential translates an `Each`
as the body once per element of the collection, not as whatever `ActionWitness.lowered` answers.
Taking the elements from production would hand the oracle production's answer to the one question
the `Each` arm asks; stating the toy's lowering — substitution writes the element over the
placeholder in expressions only and never changes an action's shape — means a toy whose
substitution ever did change a shape shows as a divergence. Every flow case carries the core's price
as a literal beside it, so the agreement is with a figure a reader checks by hand and not with
whatever production said, and a saturating corpus asserts each of its prices reaches the bound
before comparing.

**Not claimed.** That the shipped prices are the RIGHT prices for any placement's policy
(`budget-ceilings-are-policy`); that a `seq`-backed payload is finite (`lazy-payload-cap-assumed`);
and anything about the UI tier's data-bearing weighing or its driver's G2 stage, which are that
repository's evidence (D32).

## D36 — `Each` over a collection the STORE holds: the extent is read ONCE at entry under a ceiling the tree declares, recorded in the trace and the journal, and is the only extent ever used again; amends D21, and D2 already permitted it (2026-10-08)

**2026-10-08. Phase 1991. Records the operator's ruling of 2026-10-02 (yes, under four conditions);
amends D21 (the bound of an iteration may now come from the store, its LIMIT stays in the tree) and
extends D29 (the collection may be the store's, not only the tree's). Under D14: `proofs/BoundedFold.fst`
and `proofs/Staging.fst` were restated and re-proved, with `Undo.fst` and `EffectGate.fst` taking the
new shape through their list lemmas, before a `.fs` moved. Written before any `.fs` change, as the
phase asked.**

D29 gave both axes `Each` over a LITERAL collection, and said what it foreclosed: "a collection the
store holds — a region's extent read once, recorded in the trace, replayed from the record — is Phase
1991's, under the operator's four conditions". The commoner intent is "every row of this data" — a
spreadsheet macro walking `End(xlDown)` or `UsedRange`, the verifiable-data-agent plan's class B — and
the fourth witness measured the gap as finding G2 (`docs/generic-tier.md` §3.12): a region resolved
at import is a literal, so a row appended after the import is invisible to every later run.

**0. D2 already permitted this.** D2 permits "structural recursion over finite data and bounded
iteration (a repeat whose count is a literal or a validated-range parameter)". Iteration over a
finite collection the state holds IS structural recursion over finite data; what D2 asks is that the
WORST-CASE cost remain a function of the tree, which is what the ceiling below keeps. Nothing in D2
moves. What moves is D21's "the bound is fixed by the tree": the actual COUNT may now come from the
store; its LIMIT stays in the tree.

**The operator's ruling, 2026-10-02 — YES, under four conditions, recorded here in substance:**

1. **Finite, and enumerable through the state witness.** The collection is one the domain can
   enumerate. A domain that cannot does not offer the case, and a core path that would need it is a
   compile error (D20's axis rule), never a runtime default.
2. **A ceiling in the tree.** Every store-bound `Each` declares a ceiling, a literal in the tree (or
   a range-validated parameter, which is the same thing: the top of the range). The budget prices at
   the ceiling, and an extent over it is refused BEFORE the first element. The worst-case cost
   therefore remains a function of the tree, which is D2's purpose.
3. **Snapshot at entry, recorded, and the only extent ever used again.** The extent is read ONCE,
   when the loop is entered, and recorded. The body cannot change which elements are walked — a row
   it appends to the region does not extend the running loop, which is what keeps a store-bound loop
   TOTAL — though it may read and write the current values of the elements it is given. Reversal
   and replay read the recorded extent, never the live store.
4. **The envelope states both.** The demanded projection names the collection and the ceiling, so
   the signed effect envelope (D15) reads "iterates THIS collection, at most N".

**1. The shape: the collection gains a SOURCE, beside the literal, on both axes.** `Collection<'Source>`
is `Literal of elements: JVal list | Stored of source: 'Source * ceiling: int`, and `Each` carries one
where it carried a `JVal list`. What the source IS differs per axis, as what the placeholder stands in
does (D29 item 1):

- On the DISPATCH axis `'Source` is `'Expr`: the collection is an expression resolved against the
  binding store at entry, through the same `ExprWitness.Resolve` a parameter bound resolves through,
  and must resolve to a `JArr` — the elements. A domain with no dispatch axis has no `'Expr` value to
  put there (condition 1, by typing).
- On the STATE axis `'Source` is `StateCollection<'Node>`: a NAME, which the demanded projection and
  the journal use, and a READ, `'Node -> JVal list`, the domain's own enumeration of the state it
  holds — reached through the state the plan holds at the op's position, which is the state axis
  (D20). A domain that cannot enumerate a collection never constructs the case; no member of the
  state witness was added, so no domain fills anything vacuously. Two collections are the same
  collection when they are the same NAME: the name is the identity the projection states and the
  journal subjects, and a domain that gives two reads one name has misnamed one of them.

**2. Read once, at entry; the ceiling first; then lowered exactly as a literal.** The fold
(`BoundedActions`) and the plan (`Handler.planOps`) read the extent ONCE, before the first element,
and refuse: a NEGATIVE ceiling (as a negative literal bound is refused); an extent over the ceiling
("the collection's extent is over its declared ceiling"), with nothing run, written, staged or emitted;
on the dispatch axis a source that does not resolve, resolves to something other than a list, or
errors, each with its own reason, as a parameter bound's are. Past the check, the extent is the
collection, and the lowering is D29's — `ActionWitness.lowered` / `StateWitness.lowered` over the
extent — so what runs is the SEQUENCE of the substituted bodies and nothing downstream learns a new
shape. The model's `each_of_is_each_over_extent` (`BoundedFold.fst`) and `each_of_plans_as_each_over_extent`
(`Staging.fst`) are the equations; `each_of_over_ceiling_runs_nothing` / `..._plans_nothing` are the
refusals. A placeholder's scope is unchanged: the body is walked once, unsubstituted (D29 item 5).

**3. Recorded in the trace; the inverse reads the record.** `Trace` gains `EachOf of extent: JVal list *
elements: Trace list`: a reversible run records the extent it READ beside the elements that ran. The
inverse of a store-bound `Each` run lowers the body over the RECORDED extent and inverts the result as
a sequence — `BoundedActions.reverse` never consults the store for it, and the type says so: `reverse`
takes a program and a trace and no store. This is why a store-bound `Each` is IN the reversible
fragment where a parameter-bound `Repeat` is not (D21: "a parameter bound is read from the store the
body may have overwritten"): the count is not re-read, it is recorded. The element is still a value
written over the placeholder, not a cell the body can overwrite (D29 item 4), so D21's reversal
argument carries over unchanged. `each_of_reverse_is_sequence_reverse` in the model. On the op axis
the undo trail already records every lowered edit with its pre-state (D22), so an undo runs exactly the
recorded number of inverses; nothing there re-reads the region.

**4. Journaled; the replay serves the record.** D23 journals every arm that reaches OUTSIDE. The
state a handler plans over is the host's, handed in at each run, and a replay of an earlier invocation
is handed the host's CURRENT state — so a region that grew since the recorded run would, re-read,
change the replay, which condition 3 forbids. The extent read is therefore a journaled step: one seam,
`ExtentReader` — `string -> (unit -> Result<JVal list, string>) -> Result<JVal list, string>`, the
subject and the live read — carried on the `ServerEffectRegistry` (`ReadExtent`; `denyAll` reads live)
and handed to the compute stage's fold through the `HandlerArm` (`ReadExtent`; `inert` reads live).
The durable interpreter wraps it exactly as it wraps a host call and an op performer (`wrapAt`, under
the capability `ReadExtent`, the subject the collection's name on the state axis and the binding keys
the source reads on the dispatch axis), so an extent read takes its ordinal from the same cursor, is
journaled as the step's completed value (the extent as a `JArr`), and on replay is SERVED from the
record: the live state is not consulted, a replay whose recomputation reaches a different collection
at that ordinal diverges (`durable-replay-divergence`), and a journal written before this phase —
which holds no `ReadExtent` step — replays unchanged, because a handler with no store-bound `Each`
reaches the seam never. This is the journal extension D23 declared is not a specification act: §7.1
of the wire specification journals ops and names no step vocabulary. Not modelled: the model's extent
arrow reads the state; that the durable interpreter serves the recorded value is tested
(`GridWitnessTests` class B, `ToyDurableReplayTests`).

**5. Priced at the ceiling; the envelope names both.** `Budget.actionCascadeCost` prices a store-bound
`Each` as ONE step (the read) plus the body's cost times the ceiling — the parameter-bound repeat's
rule at the top of its range, D35's "a repeat by the top of its bound" — so the price needs no store,
and the budget oracle maps the shape to exactly that repeat (`ARepeat (BParameter 0 ceiling)`), which
is the law `repeat_priced_at_top` already covers; no shape was added to `Budget.fst`. The demanded
projection gains `Iterations: IterationDemand list` — `{ Collection: string; Ceiling: int }` — on both
tiers: the dispatch axis names what the source expression reads (its `BindingUse` keys), the state
axis names the collection; the document gains the member `iterations` and moves to **version 7**.
The argument policy sees the body's reach with the placeholder STANDING, because the addresses a
run-time extent will supply are not in the tree: an allow-list that binds addresses therefore refuses
a store-bound loop whose addresses it cannot see, which is condition 2 doing its work, and a deployer
that wants the loop admits the collection by its name in the demanded document. The replay
classification reads a store-bound `Each` as it reads a parameter bound — resolved at dispatch,
undecidable from the declared form — beside the body's own defects.

**6. The specification does not move, for the reason D29 item 6 gave.** The wire never spells a view
shape; the collection source travels in the DOMAIN's codec (the toy's and the grid's test codecs gain a
case). The demanded document is deliberately ungoverned by the specification (§11.2, "the
demanded-effect projection") and its version is this repository's; the journal step is D23's
not-a-specification-act. No schema, fixture byte, refusal class or rule moves; the codec families and
the driver scenarios pass byte for byte, with `FUARAN_PROGRAM_SPEC` naming the specification clone the
gate certified against.

**7. What the model owns, and what it does not.** The model keeps D29's posture: it sees the
collection only through the elements the witness hands it, already lowered — `VEachOf act source
ceiling extent elements` on the dispatch axis, `OEachOf collection ceiling extent elements` on the op
axis — because substitution into its abstract action and op types is not a thing it can define. What
it ADDS is the read: a witness arrow (`w_as_elements` over a resolved value; `w_read_extent` over the
state), called once at entry, and the ceiling check against what it answers, so `each_of_is_each_over_extent`
is conditional on the store holding the extent the view was lowered over, and `each_of_over_ceiling_runs_nothing`
is unconditional. The obligation this puts on the differential host, stated: it lowers over the
extent the same store answers, through production's `Substitute` (the `each-substitution-preserves-shape`
row), and a host that lowered over another extent would show as a divergence. The trace's `TEachOf`
records what the arrow ANSWERED, not the view's field, which is how the model says "recorded".

**Version.** Rides the `0.8.0` draft: the slot is untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking
(D34), and this is breaking of the same class — the `collection` field of `ActionView.Each` and
`OpView.Each` changes type, `Trace` gains a case, `HandlerArm` and `ServerEffectRegistry` gain a
member, `DemandedProjection` gains a field and the demanded document a version. `STABILITY.md` has
the consumer's account and `docs/migrations/phase-1991.md` the diff.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** The ceiling is in the TREE; a store-bound `Each` with no
ceiling is not expressible, by design. The body cannot extend the running loop. The collection's
elements are VALUES; what an op does with an element it reads is still the op's own literal operand
(fuaran#2186 — an op operand resolved against the plan — builds beside this and is not foreclosed:
nothing here fixes what an operand may be, only what the collection is). A store-bound `Each` on the
dispatch axis reads the BINDING store; a collection in the tree a dispatch-axis fold cannot see stays
an op-axis construct, which is where a grid's regions live.

## D37 — A revoked op performer reads as ABSENT in coverage: `ServerCoverage` gains a withdrawn-arm slot consulted before the gate, and a new finding `ServerCapabilityWithdrawn` says so; amends D28 item 2 (2026-10-08)

**2026-10-08. Phase 1993. Amends D28 item 2 on the operator's ruling of 2026-10-02 (the fuaran#1986
close-out): a revoke is permanent, so coverage reports it as an absence, not a policy refusal.**

D28 carried a revoked op performer on coverage's GATE, so the demanded-effect check reported
`ServerGateRefusesCapability "ApplyOps"`, and named the cost: the coverage vocabulary splits
absences ("no policy makes it reachable") from policy refusals ("only this one is resolved by
changing policy"), the controls already follow that split for a host performer and a suspend, and
the op-performer revoke was the one revoke that read as policy — telling an operator that a policy
change would fix something no `Controls.step` arm can lift. D28 named the revisit and the operator
took it.

**1. `ServerCoverage` gains `Withdrawn: Set<string>` — the gate-facing capabilities whose performer
the host has withdrawn.** It is the registration fact the arms that need no host function lacked
(`HostFunctions` is that fact for the host-function arm). Empty by default: `ServerCoverage.nothing`
and every builder carry the empty set, and empty means exactly what coverage meant before the member
existed. A set of capability names rather than an op-performer flag, because `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`'s
coverage model is placement-generic and knows nothing of an op performer — the placement says WHICH
arm it withdrew, in the vocabulary the check already speaks.

**2. The check consults it BEFORE the gate.** For each demanded capability: withdrawn → an absence;
else the gate as before. That is the order the server-tier check already states for host functions —
"registration before policy … the fact policy cannot fix, first" — applied to the other half of the
split. So a session both revoked and suspended reports the op arm as withdrawn: no resume restores it,
and a finding that let the suspend speak for it would again send the operator to policy.

**3. The finding is a NEW case, `CoverageFinding.ServerCapabilityWithdrawn of capability` — the
shard's form (2), chosen over the operator's preferred form (1), reuse of
`UnregisteredServerFunction "ApplyOps"`, because form (1)'s text cannot be made true without
contortion.** Three facts decided it:

- `UnregisteredServerFunction`'s meaning, in its own documentation and in `describe`, is "a handler
  calls host function '…', for which this host registered no performer". An op stage calls no host
  function; read for `ApplyOps` that sentence is false, and it sends a host looking for a function
  registration it was never asked to make.
- `describe` sees only the finding, and the finding carries only the string. A host function MAY be
  registered under the name `ApplyOps` (`ServerEffectRegistry.register` does not refuse it; 1983
  accepted that one revoke withdraws both), so special-casing the wording on the string would
  describe a genuine host function named `ApplyOps` as the op stage, and would put the Server
  placement's reserved key into the placement-generic `Bounded` package.
- The only general rewording ("a handler needs the performer registered as '…'") changes the text of
  every host-function finding a consumer reads today, including the repair messages a sibling
  evaluation suite builds from `describe`.

The new case costs every EXHAUSTIVE match over `CoverageFinding` an arm. In this repository there is
one, `describe`; the consumers found outside it match with a wildcard. It is declared between
`UnregisteredServerFunction` and `ServerGateRefusesCapability`, keeping the absences before the
policy finding in declaration order. Its text names the capability and says the performer was
withdrawn, and says nothing about policy.

**4. `Controls.coverage` carries a revoked op performer in the slot and leaves the gate the
registry's under the controls.** The condition is D28 item 1's, unchanged — `OpPerformance.Performed`
with the key in `Revoked` — so the report and the run are still decided from the same two facts.
`DurableControls.coverage` keeps its signature and follows. `coverage.Gate "ApplyOps"` now answers
what the registry's gate answers; the withdrawal is read from `coverage.Withdrawn`.

**5. What did not move.** A suspended session reads as `ServerGateRefusesCapability` (a suspend is
lifted by `Resume`: the policy class). A revoked host performer reads as
`UnregisteredServerFunction`. Nothing revoked, and `OpPerformance.InMemory` (D26 §5, D28 item 5), give
the registry's coverage and the same findings: the tests compare host functions, channels, the
withdrawn set, the gate capability by capability, and the findings, under an empty stream, a host
revoke, a suspend and a throttle, for both performances. Monotonicity is D28 item 6's, read off the
same `Revoked`. No signature, wire member, fixture byte, demanded-document byte, control-stream byte
or proof statement moves; coverage is not part of any proof.

**Version.** Rides the `0.8.0` draft: untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking (D34, D36), and
this is breaking of the same class — `ServerCoverage` gains a field (FS0764 on a full literal) and
`CoverageFinding` a case. `STABILITY.md` has the consumer's account.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** The slot names withdrawn arms by capability, so a future
withdrawal of another gate-only arm (none exists today) reports through it without a new member.
Coverage still carries no actor or reason (D28 item 3 stands). A consumer that read the op performer's
withdrawal as `ServerGateRefusesCapability "ApplyOps"`, or as `coverage.Gate "ApplyOps" = false`,
reads `ServerCapabilityWithdrawn "ApplyOps"` / `coverage.Withdrawn` once it adopts this draft.

## D38 — A declared result target is refused by the CODEC at every subject, read through the subject's own call in the witness's view; a program's stays the fold's; amends D9 and closes D31's second finding (2026-10-08)

D9 refused a call that declares its own result target, and the specification's §9.5 says a host MUST
refuse it at every placement. The codec kept that promise at one subject only. `ProgramWire`'s check
reads the DOCUMENT for a `Call` carrying `into`, which is the referenced subject's spelling; a toy
handler document whose `Ring` is `targeted` decoded, and only the fold refused it, later and as a
diagnostic rather than a refusal of the document. So the refusal a host met depended on the subject's
vocabulary, which §9.5 does not allow. D31 recorded this as a finding.

**The choice.** Two routes were open: the generic codec recognises a target through the subject's
witness, or §9.5 is restated so the refusal point is the fold wherever a subject declares no such
reading. The first is taken, because the reading already exists. `ActionView.Call` carries
`declaresTarget`, every witness fills it, and the fold refuses through it today. Nothing new is asked
of a domain, and the codec and the fold now read one declaration of what a target is, so they cannot
disagree about it. The second route would have made §9.5 weaker for every subject other than the one
the codec happens to spell, and would have left a handler document that names a target accepted by
the codec of a host whose fold never runs it.

**The mechanism.** `decodeActionIn` decodes through the witness as before, then walks the DECODED
action through `View`: a `Call` whose `declaresTarget` is true, at any depth the composition shapes
reach (a sequence's members, a selection's arms, a repeat's body, an iteration's body), is refused as
`tree-declared-result-target`, with the same log-safe detail. Nothing past the decoder is constructed
and nothing runs. `HandlerWire` needs no change: its compute stage already decodes through
`decodeActionIn`.

**The document check stays, beside the view walk.** The view does not decompose a leaf, and the
referenced subject views some actions that hold continuations as leaves (its confirm round trip), so a
`Call` with `into` inside one of those is reachable by the document check and not by the view. Removing
the document check would have weakened the referenced subject's refusal to buy tidiness. It is the
referenced subject's spelling in the generic codec, and that is now stated beside it. Moving it into
that subject's own decoder is the clean end state, and it is that subject's repository's act, not
this one's.

**What the specification says now.** §9.5 states that the rule is read through the subject's own call.
In a handler document the codec refuses, at every subject. In a program the tree's own codec belongs
to another specification and may admit the shape, so the fold refuses, at every subject, as before.
§10.7 lists the toy's refusal as its fourth owned-subject refusal. The corpus gains
`toy-handler/reject-result-target`, a targeted `Ring` inside a sequence, refused for the referenced
vector's class. `toy-handler/reject-ring-into` keeps `undeclared-member`, and the text now says why:
`into` is not the toy's spelling of a target, and §2.9 refuses the member before any reading of the
action is made. No referenced vector's bytes or class moved.

**Version.** No public signature moves: the new walk is private, and `decodeActionIn` keeps its type.
A toy-subject handler document that decoded before is refused now, which is the conformance
correction §9.5 already required; the `0.8.0` draft carries no entry for it.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** A domain cannot make its call's target invisible to the
codec while the fold refuses it: the two read one view. A domain that hides a call inside a leaf hides
it from both, as it always did. The document check's referenced spelling remains in the generic codec
until that subject's decoder carries it.

## D39 — The durable tier journals the plan's ENTRY READ through the run's `EntryReader`, so a re-entry plans against what the dead run saw and a resume that would plan differently is refused naming the read; the op performer and its contracts see the run's prefix; a facet is declared per effect kind; contracts compose (2026-10-09)

**Context.** D12 made the durable interpreter journal the arms that reach outside, and D23 extended
that to a performed op stage, on one premise both state: the plan phase is a function of the entry
state, so a re-run recomputes the same staged list and the journaled stages are served at the same
ordinals. A verb whose plan READS THE WORLD breaks the premise the moment its own perform phase moves
what it read. The first consumer to run a mutating verb on `Durable.runWith` — a verb whose plan reads
a store inside its state witness's `Apply` before deciding what to perform, performs an op that
retires what it read, and is interrupted after the op and before the stage after it — found that the
re-entry re-planned against the moved store, was refused by the domain's own "nothing matched" before
any journaled stage, and the stage after the op stayed undone. The resume held only because that
consumer's test host re-supplied the dead run's read by hand, which is machinery beside Program that
Program's claim was supposed to make unnecessary. Until this, no verb whose plan reads what it later
moves was durable on Program, which is every verb that reads its store before writing it. Three
smaller findings travelled with it from the same consumer: the op performer and its contract were
handed the state as of the op and the op, but not the state before it nor the receipts of the earlier
op stages, so a stage whose act is "the receipts before me" read them back from the host's journal;
one idempotency facet covered the whole op performer, so idempotent writes and a non-idempotent push
could not be declared apart; and `performedChecked` took one contract, so several were nested by hand.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** The finding reproduces at the toy witness without any
consumer: a witness whose `Apply` reads a slot of a world, an op performer that retires the slot, a
journal that dies at the host call's attempt, and a re-entry under a live-reading witness — refused
`Failed("ApplyOps", "no-match: …")` from the plan phase, nothing served, the host call never run
(`DurableInterpreterTests`, the first case). 1905 and 1991 had already journaled two plan-phase reads
(a staged query, a store-bound `Each`'s extent) through the one wrapper at their ordinals; the entry
read is the third of that family, not a new mechanism. The durable model's parameters the theorems
assume: the journal snapshot is read once at entry (`durable-journal-read-once`), the read's subject is
the host's name for it, the read and the staged calls take their ordinals from one cursor in
plan-then-perform order (stated as a model-bridge assumption, pinned by the host), and what the plan
does with the served value is the host's `Apply`, opaque as `w_apply` already is.

**The choice — (a) a journaled plan-phase read, through a reader the run hands the witness.** The
shard named two routes. (b), an entry-state record on the journal port — the invocation records the
world it planned against and a re-entry plans against the record — is not available to Program as it
stands: the state witness has `Canonical` and `Diff` but no decoder, so a recorded entry state could be
compared with but never reconstructed, and the read the finding is about happens inside `Apply`, not
at the store handed to the run, so recording the entry store would have recorded the wrong thing.
(a) is taken, in the shape 1991 already cut for the extent: `EntryReader` is `ExtentReader`'s shape
over one `JVal` — handed the read's NAME and the live read, answering what the plan should see.
`Durable.runReading` takes the witness as a FUNCTION of this run's reader, so a domain closes its
`Apply` over it and nothing is asked of Program's core or of the witness types; the read goes through
`wrapAt` at an ordinal of its own under `ReadEntry`, the subject the read's name, the completed value
the host's answer, declared idempotent (a read repeats freely; an undecided read at a plan-phase
ordinal has performed nothing yet, so re-reading is a first read) and asked no operator refusal. On
re-entry the read is served, the plan stages the same calls, and the op stages are served at the
ordinals they were recorded at. `runWith`, `run`, `arm`, `stepVia` and the controls-aware forms are
`runReading` over a witness that ignores the reader, unchanged. **Two alternatives to the reader's
delivery were rejected:** a mutable handle the run installs into (a read outside a run would have to
be refused at run time, and the cursor it shares is already the one mutable cell this file apologises
for) and a reader on the effect registry (the witness is built before the run wraps the registry, so
it would close over the unwrapped reader).

**The refusal is typed and names the read.** With the read served, a resume cannot plan differently
by reading the world; it can plan differently only by reaching, at the read's ordinal, a different
read or a stage, or by reaching a stage where the record holds a read — the resumed program is not
the recorded one, or the entry store handed in differs. That is the wrapper's divergence check, and
where either side of it is an entry read the refusal is `durable-entry-read-diverged:<subject>`
rather than `durable-replay-divergence`, so the halt a caller reads says which read moved rather
than the domain's "nothing matched". An op-stage or host-call divergence keeps its code, so the
Phase 1980 differential is untouched.

**The three smaller findings, in the same vocabulary.** (F-RECEIPTS) `OpPerformance.Performed` is
handed `OpPrefix` first — the planned state the op was applied TO and the receipts of the op stages
performed before it, in perform order; the handler's perform fold threads the receipts, so under the
durable interpreter a served stage's RECORDED receipt is in the next performer's prefix exactly as a
performed one's would be, which is what makes a resumed commit see the dead run's receipts without
the host reading them back. `OpContract.Holds` takes the prefix too, so a contract can state what an
op owed; `OpContract.at` is the prefix-blind shape every contract had. (F-FACET) `PerformerFacets`
gains `OpKinds`, a facet per effect KIND, a kind being an argument name the op's reach declares — the
vocabulary a domain already declares per op for the policy, so no second classification is asked of
it. What repeating one op does is the MEET over its kinds, a kind nobody declared reading as the
whole-performer declaration; the durable wrapper reads it per op. The static derivation, which is
handed no witness, reads the arm as the meet over everything declared — sound, coarser than the
wrapper's per-op reading, and a deliberate choice over threading the witness through
`Facets.ofEffect` and every caller: the derivation is a handler-level lower bound and the wrapper is
where the decision is taken. Revisit if a host needs a write-only handler to derive idempotent
beside a declared push. (F-CONTRACTS) `performedChecked` takes a list, composed by
`OpContract.checkAll` with the first declared innermost, so the first that rejects names the refusal
and a host that nested by hand reads the same one.

**What this phase deliberately did not do — the finding effect.** The shard's fifth item, a typed
"report a finding" effect journaled into the trace so a host derives an invocation's outcome from it,
widens the closed `ServerEffect` vocabulary D3 says is widened by host act and not by a new arm, puts
a case on the handler document's wire form and so on the program wire specification and its corpus,
and reaches `HandlerWire`, `ServerDemanded` and the undo classification. That is a design with a
specification act in it, held by other work this tier, and it is deferred to a phase of its own rather
than half-cut here; nothing in this entry forecloses it, and the `Notify` arm is the obvious first
candidate for its shape.

**Version.** Rides the `0.8.0` draft, which is already breaking: a DU case's payload and a record
field's type change (`STABILITY.md` says what a consumer pays). The journal port gains no case — a
capability value, as 1905 and 1991 — so no recorded journal and no wire byte moves.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** A plan's read of the world is now something Program
records, so a host that persists the entry read beside the journal is building what Program provides.
A read a domain performs OUTSIDE the reader — a witness that ignores it and reads live — is not
journaled and is exactly as durable as before, which is the host's choice and is visible in the
journal's capabilities. The one-cursor assumption (the read's ordinal precedes the staged list's) is
a property of `wrapAt` the model states and the host pins rather than proves; a second plan-phase
arm through the wrapper inherits it as the two before it did.

## D40 — A leaf can declare itself OPAQUE, with a reason class; the demanded document names every opaque leaf at version 8, and coverage REFUSES one by default until the host accepts its reason class (2026-10-09)

**2026-10-09. Phase 2130.** A leaf declaration said what the leaf may demand — its effect kinds and its
host calls — and nothing else. A leaf that declared nothing therefore read, in the demanded document,
exactly like an act that does nothing. That is true of most such leaves and false of one kind: an act the
host performs in its own process, which no walk can see into because nothing the tree carries describes
it. The first instantiation has one (its in-process message arm). A deployer reading a signed envelope
could not tell "harmless" from "unanalysable", which is the one distinction the envelope exists to make.

**1. `LeafDeclaration` gains `Opaque: OpaqueLeaf option`; `OpaqueLeaf` is `{ Reason; Name }`.** `None`
is the claim that the two lists are the whole of what the leaf can do; `Some` says they are not, names
the act and gives the reason CLASS — `in-process` is the one this repository knows of. Both are names the
witness writes, never payload, so the record is log-safe on `HostCallDemand`'s terms. An opaque leaf may
still declare effect kinds and host calls; the mark says there is something besides them, not that they
are void. `LeafDeclaration.none` and `LeafDeclaration.opaque reason name` are the constructors, so a
witness built from them does not break the next time the declaration gains a member.

**2. The reason class is a string, not a closed union.** The core is domain-generic and has one class in
view. A closed union with one case would pretend to an enumeration nobody has made, and every domain that
met a second reason would need this package to move before it could say so. What a host does with a class
is accept it or not (item 4), and a class it has never heard of is one it has not accepted — the same
fail-closed reading an unregistered effect name gets. The document carries the class as written, as it
carries an unknown effect arm.

**3. `Demanded.ofTree` and `ofAction` carry it, as `DemandedProjection.OpaqueLeaves`, through every
composition shape** — a sequence's members, both arms of a selection, a repeat's body once, a literal
`Each`'s lowered bodies and a stored `Each`'s body — distinct and sorted by reason then name. It is a
separate member from `OpaqueHandlers` and must stay one: those are NODES whose action the wire could not
carry; these are actions the wire did carry, whose behaviour lives in the host. The document gains
`"opaqueLeaves":[{"reason":…,"name":…}]` between `iterations` and `server` and moves to **version 8**;
`decodableVersions` is `[8]`. The reader refuses a version-8 document without the member (absent is "the
producer predates it", empty is "it looked and found no escape", and only the second is a claim about the
program), refuses an undeclared member inside an entry, and refuses an out-of-order list, on the terms of
every other client-tier member. The signed envelope's drift names an opaque leaf on either side.

**4. Coverage REFUSES an opaque leaf by default: `HostCoverage.Opaque: Set<string>` is the set of reason
classes the host accepts running, empty in `HostCoverage.nothing`, and every opaque leaf whose class is
not in it is the new finding `CoverageFinding.UnacceptedOpaqueLeaf (reason, name)`.** The phase asked
whether a host's check should refuse an opaque leaf or only report it. Report-only was the precedent
`OpaqueHandlers` set, and it was set for a reason that does not transfer: on a decoded tree an opaque
handler is INERT — the wire carried no action, so nothing runs — and flagging it would fire on every tree
carrying such a node until the check was ignored. An opaque leaf is the opposite case: the wire carried
the action and the host will perform it, with nothing in the tree saying what that does. The host-call
surface's "unconstrained by default" (`HostCalls = None`) does not transfer either: it rests on those
calls being no-ops on the bounded path, which an opaque leaf is not. What remains is the posture every
other seam here takes — a host that declares nothing covers nothing — so running an escape is a statement
the host makes (`HostCoverage.acceptingOpaque [ "in-process" ]`), not one it is spared. No effect policy
lifts the finding: a permissive gate accepts effects, and an opaque leaf is not one. The finding is
declared after `UncoveredStateNamespace` and before the server-tier findings, and `checkProjection`
returns it in that position. Its text says the leaf is opaque and names the class.

**5. What this costs a consumer.** A full record literal of `LeafDeclaration`, `DemandedProjection` or
`HostCoverage` meets FS0764; an exhaustive match over `CoverageFinding` meets a new case; a stored or
signed version-7 document is refused by version and is re-emitted or re-signed. When a witness first
declares a leaf opaque, every host checked against its trees reports the escape until it accepts the
class — which is the point, and is the adopting phase's migration to state, not this one's to hide.

**Version.** Rides the `0.8.0` draft: untagged, publicly unpinned and already breaking (D34, D36, D37),
and this is breaking of the same class. No wire member, fixture byte, refusal class or rule of the program
wire specification moves: the demanded document is deliberately ungoverned by the specification (its
§11.2), as D36 item 6 recorded for `iterations`. This repository's `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json`
moved to version 8 by hand, to exactly the encoder's bytes, with five vectors for the member; the
emitter that writes it lives with the first instantiation's adapter and re-emits it when that tier
adopts this draft.

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** A witness can no longer make an escape read as a no-op in
the document without saying so falsely: the declaration is the witness author's, and NOTHING checks it —
a witness that views an in-process act as an ordinary empty leaf still projects nothing, exactly as
before. This decision gives an honest witness a way to disclose; it does not detect a dishonest one.
The first instantiation does not declare any leaf opaque yet: its in-process message arm adopts this in
fuaran#2194, after this draft is released and that tier's pin is raised. Until then no shipped tree's
document carries an opaque leaf, and the disclosure exists in the core only.

## D41 — A plan's read of the world is TYPED: `Read.Available` decoded by the store's own named codec, or `Read.Unavailable` naming the read and why; the run's unavailable reads are enumerable before its first performed op; a read's decode is memoised by the CONTENT read; builds on D39 and changes no existing read arm (2026-10-09)

**Context.** The first consumer to move a store-reading verb family toward Program reported two
findings about the reads such a verb makes. First, a read that could not answer had no type of its
own. A consumer whose guards turned a load error into "no finding" silently dropped what it could not
read. The sharpest instance was a protective record that failed to parse and was read as ABSENT, so a
protection disappeared with nothing raised. A second instance of the same class: three readers of one
store went through a generic JSON reader instead of the store's own codec. Every well-formed record
carrying a `null` member, which the wire value model cannot represent, was refused by the generic
reader and read as nothing, with no error. Second, a verb that reads the same store several times in
one invocation should decode it once, and the obvious memo key, (path, length, write time), is
unsound. On a coarse file clock a same-length rewrite inside one tick reads as unchanged, and the memo
serves the old decode.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** No read in Program carried a typed unavailable case,
and no handler memoised a read. But the shard's framing, "Program's read effects return a value or
fail", describes the RIGHT behaviour for the arms Program owns, not the defect. Each existing read arm
is fail-closed. A `RunQuery` the evaluator cannot answer halts the handler with a `QueryFault` (D34),
and a store-bound extent that cannot be read halts the fold before its first element (D36). An empty
table and an empty extent are answers of their own, so neither arm can confuse "could not read" with
"read nothing". The conversion the finding describes happens in exactly one place: the read a domain
makes INSIDE its plan, through D39's `EntryReader`, whose answer is a `Result<JVal, string>` the
host's own `Apply` decodes and is free to default. That is where this decision acts, and nowhere else.
The toy witness's 2165 fixture shows the class in miniature: its world answers a slot it does not hold
with the empty object, and its `Apply` reads the empty object as `no-match`.

**The choice — a typed, codec-named layer over the entry reader (`Reads`), not a change to any arm.**

- *The type.* `Read<'T> = Available of 'T | Unavailable of ReadUnavailable`. `ReadUnavailable` names
  the read's SUBJECT (the journal's, the host's own name for it) and its `ReadCause`: `NotRead reason`
  (the store could not be read, in the host's words) or `Undecodable(codec, reason)` (the store
  answered and its own codec refused). The two causes are kept apart because their remedies differ.
  There is no third case: "could not read" has no spelling as an empty value.
- *The codec.* A read NAMES the codec that decodes its answer: `ReadCodec<'T>`, a name and a pure
  `Decode: string -> Result<'T, string>` over the content read. It answers the codec's value, or
  `Unavailable` carrying the codec's name and the codec's own reason. "Parsed some JSON and found
  nothing" is not an answer the type can give. The tests pin the recorded instance with the real
  generic reader: `Json.parse` refuses a record whose `note` member is `null`, and a codec that knows the
  store's shape reads it.
- *The journal record.* `Reads.Read` performs the raw read (the store's content, or the host's reason
  there was none) and journals THAT through the run's entry reader as a `ReadRecord` (`{"content": …}`
  or `{"unavailable": …}`), under D39's `ReadEntry` capability with the read's subject. An unavailable
  read is therefore a COMPLETED answer, journaled like any other. A resume meets the same
  unavailability rather than re-reading a world that has since moved, and a run that refused on it
  replays the same refusal. The decode is not journaled: the codec is a pure function of the content,
  so a resume decodes the recorded content and gets the recorded value. An `Error` from `Read` is the
  TIER's, never the store's: D39's `durable-entry-read-diverged`, or a served record that is not a
  `ReadRecord` (`ReadRecord.Malformed`). The plan halts on it.
- *Degraded reads before the first op.* `Reads` keeps the run's unavailable reads, distinct, in read
  order (`Degraded`), and `Refusal ()` is the refusal a plan returns for them:
  `read-unavailable: <subject> (<cause>); …`. Every op is performed after the plan completes (D8), so
  any `Apply` of the plan phase precedes the first performed op. A plan whose commit step refuses on
  `Refusal ()` halts with nothing performed, naming each read it could not make, and the durable tier
  records the run as uncommitted like any other refusal.
- *Content-keyed memoisation.* The DECODE is memoised for the run, keyed by the codec's name and a
  SHA-256 over the content read. A second read of an unchanged store decodes nothing; a same-length
  rewrite inside one tick decodes the new content. The falsifier test holds the store's (length, write
  time) equal across the rewrite and asserts the answer moved; changing the key to the content's
  length turns that test red. The raw read is never memoised: each read is its own journaled answer at
  its own ordinal, so the memo can only ever serve a decode of the bytes THIS read answered. On a
  resume those are the journaled bytes, never the live world's, and never a memo of different content.

**How each existing read arm takes the shape.**

- `ReadEntry` (D39): unchanged in type and record. `Reads` is a layer over it, so a host on the raw
  reader keeps working, and a typed read is an entry read whose completed value is a `ReadRecord`.
- `ReadExtent` (D36): unchanged. Its `Error` halts the fold before the first element and an empty
  extent is `Ok []`, so the bounded tier already carries the distinction, and an `Each` body has no
  branch at which an unavailable extent could be met as a value.
- `RunQuery` (D34): unchanged. A `QueryFault` halts the handler, and an empty table is a table.
- `HostCall` with `into`: a performed effect whose refusal halts the handler, not a plan-phase read.

Turning either fail-closed halt into a value a plan may carry past would WEAKEN the default for every
host, to offer a choice no consumer has asked for.

**Alternatives considered and rejected.**

- *Change `EntryReader`'s signature to answer `Read<JVal>`.* Rejected: it moves a draft seam every 2165
  host already builds over, and the raw reader is still the right primitive for a read whose answer
  the host encodes itself. A layer costs no one anything.
- *Type `RunQuery` and the extent read too.* Rejected above: both are fail-closed by construction.
- *A Program-run gate that refuses before the perform phase whenever any read was unavailable* (the
  first consumer's own host-side shape: one refusal per verb before its first write). Rejected as the
  default. Whether a degraded read is fatal is the plan's call, since a plan may read an optional store
  and carry on without it. The gate would also have to sit inside the handler's plan-to-perform seam,
  which the durable interpreter deliberately does not fork. The ledger plus `Refusal ()` gives a plan
  that gate in one line, at its own commit step.
- *Decode into a generic `JVal` and let the host decode that.* Rejected: it is the generic-reader
  defect itself, because the wire value model cannot represent every well-formed record a store holds.
- *Memoise the raw read, or key the memo on metadata.* Rejected: a raw-read memo would serve a content
  different from the one the read journaled, and a metadata key is refuted by the falsifier above.
- *No memo, leaving it to the host.* Rejected because the content key is cheap and sound here. The
  content is already in hand (it is what the journal records), and a host memo beside Program is the
  machinery this phase exists to remove.

**Version.** Additive: new types, modules and one class; no existing type, member or case moves. It
rides the `0.8.0` draft, which is already breaking (`STABILITY.md`).

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.** A plan's read is typed when the host reads through
`Reads`. A host that reads through the raw entry reader, or live, is exactly as before, and the choice
is visible in its code. The journal records the content read, so a host whose reads are large pays the
journal for them, as it already did for a raw entry read's answer; a digest-only record would be
smaller and could not be served on a resume. The typed WRITE side (a performed op's receipt as a typed
value) and a typed finding effect are separate phases (fuaran#2197, fuaran#2195); nothing here
forecloses either. The memo's scope is one run: a host that wants decodes shared across invocations
keys its own cache the same way, by content.

## D42 — The VALUE CHANNEL on the state axis is Program's: an op's operand may be a value the planned state holds, resolved ONCE at the op's position through the expression arrow the contract already had, bound to a placeholder by a `Let` in the view and substituted into the ops beneath it; closes `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.12 G1 (2026-10-09)

**2026-10-09. Phase 2186. Records the operator's ruling of 2026-10-08 on fuaran#1992's finding G1
("the value channel is Program's, on the D18/D19 precedent, not each domain's"); the worker's
suggested disposition — one witness needs it, so the rule of three says the domain's for now — is
NOT taken, and this entry does not re-open it. Cites D1, D4, D18, D19 and §3.12 G1. Under D14:
`proofs/Staging.fst` was restated and re-proved, with `Undo.fst` and `EffectGate.fst` taking the new
shape through their list lemmas, before a `.fs` moved; `BoundedFold.fst` is untouched, because the
fold's laws are the dispatch axis's and this phase changes none of them.**

**The finding.** The grid witness (§3.12) found that an op's operands are literals of the tree and
the placeholder's element: nothing carries a value one op READ to a later op that WRITES it, and the
dispatch axis's `ExprWitness` resolves against the binding store, never the planned state. The grid
covered a copy with one fused domain op, `Copy(source, target)`; a computed write — the loop a
spreadsheet's automation writes constantly, `Cells(i, 4) = Cells(i, 3) * 2` — would have needed each
domain to carry an expression inside its own op and evaluate it in `Apply`. That is the drift D4
warned about and D19 reversed: an expression hidden inside a domain's op is invisible to the demanded
projection (the op's reach is no longer a literal), to the replay classifier (`non-literal-write` is
already a `ReplayDefect` arm, and it would never fire), and to the argument policy — so every domain
would rebuild those analyses beside Program. Data flow between ops is control structure in D1's
terms: the evaluator's, not vocabulary.

**The decision.** The state axis gains a value channel in the VIEW, not in a member:

1. **`OpView.Let of placeholder * value: StateValue<'Node> * body`** — a sixth shape beside the
   edit, the guard, the branch, the repeat and the per-element iteration. `StateValue<'Node>` is
   `{ Name: string; Resolve: 'Node -> ExprResolution }`, the exact analogue of Phase 1991's
   `StateCollection<'Node>` (`{ Name; Read }`): a name the projection states and the journal subjects
   the read with, and the domain's own read of the planned state at the op's position. Equality is by
   name, on `StateCollection`'s terms.
2. **Resolution goes through `ExprWitness.Resolve`, instantiated at the state.** `ExprWitness.value
   (expr: ExprWitness<'Expr, 'Node>) source` builds the `StateValue`: its `Resolve` is `expr.Resolve`
   with the planned state as the store, its `Name` is `ExprWitness.valueName` — the state keys
   `Uses` names under one spelling, `state:<k1>,<k2>` — so the name spells the reads. The three
   outcomes are `ExprResolution`'s: `Resolved v` binds, `NotResolved` refuses with the value named,
   `Errored reason` refuses with the domain's message verbatim (D19's route for a typed refusal).
   An operand that cannot be read is a defect, never a default.
3. **The plan resolves ONCE, at the op's position, and substitutes.** `Handler.planOps` resolves
   the value against the state the ops before it produced, substitutes it for the placeholder in
   every op of the body through the state witness's `Substitute` (D29's lowering), and plans the
   body as a sequence from the same state. What plans is the substituted body: nothing downstream
   learns a new shape, and every sequence law reaches it (`let_of_plans_as_body_when_resolved`).
4. **The resolution is journaled and served on replay**, through the placement's `ExtentReader` — a
   one-element extent under the value's name — so the durable tier journals it at its ordinal under
   `ReadExtent` exactly as a store-bound extent, and a replay is SERVED the recorded value: the live
   plan is not consulted a second time, which is D36's third condition applied to a value. No new
   reader seam, no new journal capability.
5. **Every analysis sees it.** `OpView.beneath` lists the body with the placeholder STANDING (as it
   lists a store-bound loop's), so the argument policy's `reachOfOp` and the demanded projection's
   `Reach` read every address the body writes; the value's READS are the binding op's own `Reach`,
   which the domain answers as it answers a guard's (the grid names the cells its expression reads
   under `cell`), so an allow-list over cells bounds what a computed write reads as surely as what
   it writes. `OpView.scopeDefects` binds the placeholder lexically, as an `Each` does, and refuses a
   read outside the binding and a rebinding of an enclosing name. `ProgramWire.replayDefectsOfOp`
   reports `non-literal-write` for a `Let` exactly as for an `Assign` with `from`: undecidable, not
   unsafe. `Undo.defectsOfOps` reads the body once with the placeholder standing; the binding is not
   an edit, so a grid handler's undo posture stays `reversible` and the trail records every
   substituted edit the run planned. And the demanded document gains **`values`** at **version 9**:
   `ValueDemand = { Value: string; Targets: string list }` — the value by name and the absolute
   targets of every op beneath the binding — so a reader tells a computed write from a literal one;
   "writes THESE from THIS" is what the signed envelope then says. State axis only: a dispatch-axis
   derived write already names its reads and its key under `stateNamespaces`.

**Why no new witness member.** The shard asked for the smallest change to the contract that works
and, if a member proved unavoidable, why an existing arrow does not fit. None was needed: `View` is
the arrow that already exposes everything the core reads of an op's shape, and Phase 1991 had
already shown how a read of the planned state rides it without a type parameter — a named record
with a `'Node -> …` closure, built by the domain in its own `View`. `StateWitness<'Node, 'Op>` has no
`'Expr`, and adding one would ripple through every signature in three packages to carry a type the
core never inspects; `ExprWitness<'Expr, 'Node>` instantiated at the state carries it inside the
domain instead, and `ExprWitness.value` is the only new arrow — a constructor, not an obligation.
The alternative read of the shard — an `Operands: 'Op -> StateValue<'Node> list` member on the state
witness, each edit op resolving its own operands — was rejected: it puts the expression INSIDE the
write op (the acceptance says "with no expression carried inside a domain op"), it needs the scope
check to subtract operand-bound names from `Placeholders`, and it gives the trail an op whose
recorded form differs from its declared form.

**Why the wire does not move.** An op is the domain's, encoded by its own `Stream.Encode`; the
program wire specification references the view's shapes and spells none of them (D19's argument for
the guard), and the `ReplayDefect` vocabulary already carries `non-literal-write`. The demanded
document is Program's own conformance artefact (`conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json`, read
at its authority by `DemandedCorpusReadTests`), not a program-wire artefact; its version moves here as
version 8 did (Phase 2130), and the UI tier's emitter re-emits it when that tier adopts this release.
So the five-artefact forward-coupling rule is not engaged, and the specification's text, schemas,
emitter and manifest are unchanged.

**A premise the shard carried that is false, recorded rather than built against.** The shard says
"the budget prices the expression at the existing `MaxExprNodes` bound". There is no such bound in
Program: `MaxExprNodes` is a bound of the UI tier's own budget, and Program's `InteractionBudget`
prices actions and tree nodes — the op channel has never been priced, and a dispatch-axis `from`
expression is not priced either. A `Let` is one step plus its body, as the model prices every
binding, and an expression's own cost is the domain's, as a repeat's count range is the domain's
codec's (D2 on the op axis). No mechanism was built for a bound that does not exist; a budget over
expressions on either axis is a separate decision if a witness ever pays for its absence.

**What stays.** The grid's fused `Copy(source, target)` is NOT retired. Its empty-source case is a
DEFAULT — an empty source clears the target, as a spreadsheet's copy does — and the channel refuses
an unresolved value by design; a copy through the channel is a `LetValue` under a `WhenFilled`, the
same act spelled without the default, and the test "a copy through the channel is Copy without its
default" pins the difference. The fused op remains the baseline G1 described, beside the channel that
closes it.

**Assumptions kept, with the evidence that would falsify each (D18's discipline).**

- *The planned state at the op's position is the right store.* A value is resolved against the state
  the ops BEFORE it produced, never the entry state. Falsified by a witness that needs a value read
  from a state the plan has not reached — a lookahead — which no spreadsheet loop does; that witness
  would be asking for a different construct, not a different resolution.
- *One resolution per binding is enough.* A `Let` binds one name to one value over one body; a body
  that needs two values nests two bindings, and the scope check keeps the names apart. Falsified by a
  domain whose expressions must be resolved TOGETHER (a simultaneous assignment); none is known.
- *The resolved value is a `JVal` and substitution is total.* The value crosses into the op through
  `Substitute`, so a domain whose operands cannot be filled from a `JVal` cannot use the channel.
  That is D29's assumption, inherited and unchanged; the grid fills a cell identity or a cell's
  content from a string or an integer's canonical rendering.
- *A one-element extent is an honest journal record for a value.* The journal stores the resolution
  as `[v]` under `ReadExtent`, subject the value's name; the plan refuses a recorded extent that is
  not one element. Falsified if a reader of the journal must tell a value read from an extent read by
  capability alone — then a `ReadValue` capability is one line in the durable tier and this entry's
  item 4 is amended; nothing recorded today would be unreadable.
- *The policy's static read of the body with the placeholder standing bounds what the body writes.*
  A value substituted into an ADDRESS is bounded by the standing shape, exactly as a store-bound
  element is (D36); the policy does not re-check the substituted ops at plan time. Falsified by a
  deployer whose allow-list must bind a computed address by its VALUE; the remedy is a plan-time
  re-check in `planOps`, which this entry does not build because no witness asked for it.
- *`values` with the placeholder standing is the right demand under a literal loop.* The demand
  names `state:r{i}c3` once, not three lowered values, on `iterations`'s terms rather than
  `beneath`'s. Falsified by a consumer of the demanded document that must enumerate every lowered
  value; the lowering is one `List.collect` in `OpView.values`, and the document's version would move.

**Version.** Breaking, by `STABILITY.md`'s rule: `OpView<'Node, 'Op>` gains a case (an exhaustive
match over it breaks), `DemandedProjection` gains `Values` (a full literal breaks), the demanded
document is at version 9 (a pinned reader refuses it), and `Staging.witness` gains `w_resolve` (the
oracle's model witness is a full literal). `v0.8.0` is tagged, so this advances `<Version>` to
`0.9.0` and opens its draft.

## D43 — A performed write's receipt is the performer's RETURN VALUE, typed: `OpReceipt` names each write's target and a SHA-256 digest of the bytes written; D39's prefix receipts are TYPED, not replaced; an invocation's changed set is the union of its receipts, and a commit stage refuses a write no receipt accounts for (2026-10-09)

**2026-10-09. Phase 2197.** D39 (Phase 2165) gave an op performer and its contracts the run's
PREFIX: the pre-op state and the receipts of the op stages before it. A stage whose act is "the
receipts before me" therefore stopped reading them back from the host's journal. Those receipts were
an untyped `JVal list` (`OpPrefix.Receipts`), because the receipt itself was a `JVal` (Phase 1981):
the paths a performer wrote, a sha it committed, or the empty object. An amendment to 2165's
F-RECEIPTS, written while 2165 was in flight, asked for more than what shipped. A consumer that
commits only what an invocation wrote has to know WHAT it wrote. With an untyped receipt, the only way
to know is a per-invocation receipt book that each writer records into BESIDE the effect. This
decision exists to make that book deletable.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** The prefix works as D39 describes. The handler's perform
fold threads the receipts its staged calls answer. Under the durable interpreter, a served op stage's
journaled completed value stands in for the performer's answer at the same ordinal. A resumed run
therefore already hands the next performer the dead run's receipts. Nothing typed them, though.
Program could not tell a performer answering `JObj []` from one answering a list of paths. No outcome
reported the receipts (they lived only inside the fold), and no Program function could say what an
invocation changed. The F* models (`proofs/Staging.fst`, `proofs/EffectGate.fst`) take the receipt
as an abstract value `v` and are untouched. At the toy witness, the oracle bridges production's typed
receipt to the model's value through the receipt's detail. The durable oracle states the remaining
gap: production journals `encode (ofDetail v)` where the model journals `v`.

**1. The receipt type.** `OpReceipt = { Writes: WriteReceipt list; Detail: JVal }`, and
`WriteReceipt = { Target: string; Digest: ContentDigest }`.

- *The target* is the host's own name for the place written (a path, a key), compared ordinally.
  Program gives it no structure, just as it gives a read's subject none (D39).
- *The digest* is SHA-256 over the EXACT BYTES written, rendered `sha256:` + 64 lowercase hex. This is
  the estate's one digest convention, already used by the content address (D9) and the typed read's
  memo (D41). Text is digested as its UTF-8 bytes, with no byte-order mark and no newline or Unicode
  normalisation: the digest covers the bytes the store holds, not a reading of them.
  `ContentDigest.ofText` equals `"sha256:" + Hash.sha256Hex`, and a test pins that equality. The
  representation is private. A digest is computed from content (`ofBytes`, `ofText`) or parsed from
  its rendering (`parse`), never spelled by hand. `parse` refuses uppercase, an abbreviation and any
  other algorithm.
- *The detail* is the 0.8.0 receipt, kept verbatim: anything else the performer says it did, such as
  a commit's sha or an id the store assigned. Nothing in Program reads it; a contract may.

**2. A performer returns the receipt as its RETURN VALUE.** `OpPerformance.Performed` carries
`OpPrefix -> 'Node -> 'Op -> Result<OpReceipt, string>`. `performedBy`, `performedWithPrefix` and
`performedChecked` take performers that answer `OpReceipt`. `performedWithDetail` is the 0.8.0
shape: a performer answering a `JVal`, lifted to a receipt that names no write.
`performedWithoutReceipt` answers `OpReceipt.none`. The detail-only form gets its own name, rather
than staying `performedBy`, so that the obvious registration is the typed one. If the easy name
produced write-less receipts, a writing performer registered the obvious way would contribute nothing
to the changed set. That fails closed (the commit refuses its writes), but the failure would surface
at a commit rather than at registration.

**3. 2165's `OpPrefix.Receipts` is TYPED, not replaced.** It becomes `OpReceipt list`. Its order
(perform order), its population (the op stages performed before this one) and its durable reading (a
served stage's recorded receipt counts among them) are unchanged. Replacing it would have added a
second channel beside the prefix, when the prefix is already how a later stage sees what the run did.
The typed receipt rides it instead. `OpContract.Holds` and `OpContract.at` take the typed receipt; a
0.8.0 contract reads `.Detail`.

**4. The union, and the refusal shape.**

- *What the outcome carries.* `HandlerOutcome` and `HandlerTally` gain `Receipts: OpReceipt list`,
  the receipts the op stages answered, in perform order. On an uncommitted outcome these are the
  receipts of the stages that performed before the failure: the writes `Performed` already says were
  not rolled back. Like `Flow` (D25), they are host-side only, and no outcome document carries them.
- *The union.* `Receipts.changed` (and `HandlerOutcome.changed`) is the set of targets the receipts
  name. `Receipts.final` maps each target to its LAST receipted digest, so a target written twice
  holds what was written last.
- *The check.* `Receipts.account` and `accountAll` (and `HandlerOutcome.account`) check a write a
  commit stage would stage against the receipts. A write that fails answers
  `ForeignWrite { Target; Digest; Cause }`. `Cause` is `Unreceipted` when no receipt names the target,
  and `DigestDiffers receipted` when one does but the content differs. The causes stay apart because
  their remedies differ: the first is a write the invocation never made, the second is content that
  moved since.
- *The refusal text.* `ForeignWrite.refusal` is what a commit stage's performer answers:
  `foreign-write: <target> (<cause>); …`. It names targets and digests, never content.
- *Where the check runs.* A commit stage that is itself an op stage reads the receipts before it from
  its prefix, so the check needs nothing kept beside the run. A host that commits after the run reads
  the outcome.

**Not built: a Program-run gate that refuses a commit on its own.** What a commit stages is the
host's act, and Program sees only what the host returns. The refusal is therefore a shape a commit
stage applies, as D41's `Refusal ()` is a shape a plan applies.

**5. The journal.** The durable wrapper journals an op stage's receipt as `OpReceipt.encode`:
`{"writes":[{"target":…,"digest":…},…],"detail":…}`, with the writes in perform order. The record
sits at the stage's ordinal, under `ApplyOps`, with the op's content address as its subject, which is
how D23 already identified the stage. The wrapper DECODES the value whether it was just performed or
served from the journal. A resumed run therefore gets the dead run's receipts (the same writes, the
same digests) in the next performer's prefix and in its outcome, with nothing re-performed.

A served value that is not an encoded receipt is refused as `op-receipt-malformed`. It is never read
as a receipt with no writes. A journal written by 0.8.0 holds a bare receipt in that position, and
reading it as "wrote nothing" would make a resumed commit refuse the dead run's writes as foreign, or
worse, stage nothing.

The journal port gains no case and no capability; only the shape of the completed value moves. A
journal is a host's store, not the program wire, so this involves no specification act.

**Alternatives considered and rejected.**

- *Replace the `JVal` receipt with `WriteReceipt list` and drop the detail.* A commit's sha or an
  assigned id is not a write a commit stage stages. Forcing it into a fake write would make the
  changed set lie, and dropping it would break every contract over today's receipts with nothing to
  migrate to.
- *Keep `JVal` and add a typed reading of it (a codec for `{"writes":…}`).* The type would be a
  convention nothing enforces. A performer could answer anything, and a misspelled member would read
  as "no writes".
- *One receipt per performed op stage, naming a single target.* A stage that renders a document or
  commits several files writes more than one target. Splitting it into ops to fit the receipt would
  let the receipt's shape dictate the domain's ops.
- *Digest a canonical JSON rendering of the content.* A write leaves bytes, and canonicalising them
  would let two different files that read the same share a digest.

**Version.** This is breaking, and `v0.8.0` is tagged, so it ADVANCES `<Version>` to `0.9.0`. Later
changes ride that draft (`STABILITY.md`).

**What this forecloses, and what it leaves.**

- A host that keeps a receipt book beside its performers is now building what Program provides. The
  book can be deleted once its writers return receipts.
- A performer registered through `performedWithDetail` contributes nothing to the changed set, and
  its registration shows that.
- NOTHING checks that a receipt is TRUE. A performer that writes one file and receipts another is
  believed. The receipt is the performer's own account, as D24 says of a host function's result. The
  route to checking that the receipted targets lie within what the op declared is an `OpContract`
  over the op's reach (D19).
- The typed finding effect belongs to fuaran#2195, and nothing here forecloses it.
- The first instantiation's server tests (the UI tier's `Fuaran.UI.Program.Server.Tests`) register op
  performers and contracts over `JVal` receipts. They adopt this draft when that tier raises its pin.
  The migration is mechanical (`performedWithDetail`, `.Detail`) and belongs to the adopting phase.

## D44 — The static postures read the HOST's query posture: a read under an evaluator its host could not declare a pure read is `staged-query` in both closed defect vocabularies, read off the registry by `ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture`; the program wire specification widens §7.5 at format version 3 and the demanded document moves to version 10; closes D34's "What this entry does not reach" (2026-10-09)

**2026-10-09. Phase 2187.** D34 staged a `RunQuery` whose evaluator its host could not declare a pure
read: admitted while planning, asked after the plan, journaled by the durable interpreter, recorded
on the trail as `Reached` so the undo refuses there. The runtime failed closed. The two STATIC
postures did not say so. `HandlerWire.replayReasons` and `Undo.postureOf` read only the handler's
declared form, which names no evaluator, so the demanded document (the signed envelope's subject,
D15) told a reader that a handler replays and reverses cleanly when the host it runs on would refuse
both. This entry makes the static postures say what the runtime does.

**The shape: a new arm in each closed defect vocabulary, not a reach-class on the query member.** The
shard offered both and asked for the one the documents can carry with the smallest specification
change. A reach-class on `RunQuery` would put a property of the HOST in the handler DOCUMENT. The
document's author does not know which host will run it, the same handler runs under the fold on one
host and a staged evaluator on another (D34: an evaluator is a host act, not a domain's), and an
untrusted tree could declare its own read pure. It would also move every `RunQuery` document's bytes,
or add a member whose absence a reader must interpret. A new token moves no document at all.
`ReplayDefect.StagedQuery` and `UndoDefect.StagedQuery` are the arms, both spelled `staged-query`.

**Where the host's declaration enters the static projection.** Through one value,
`ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture registry`, which is `QueryEvaluator.postureOf registry.QueryEvaluator`:
the registered evaluator's declared `Posture`, and `QueryEvaluator.inMemory`'s (`PureRead`) when none
is registered. That is the same member the handler's own staging decision reads
(`registry.QueryEvaluator`, then `QueryEvaluator.isStaged`), so the projection and the run consult one
fact. The `QueryPosture` is a REQUIRED parameter of every posture derivation:
`HandlerWire.replayReasons` and `replaySafety`; `Replay.admit`, `admitAll`, `postureOf`,
`withPostures` and `ofTreeAndHandlers`; `Undo.defectsOfStage`, `reasons`, `posture`, `postureOf`,
`withPostures` and `ofTreeAndHandlers`; `Harvest.ofProgram` and `ofRegistration`. Required, not
defaulted, because a default is the gap this entry closes: a posture computed without the host's
declaration is the posture that silently reads as the fold.

**The grades: `unsafe` for replay, `one-way` for undo.** Both are the grades the runtime already
enforces, and both are the grades of `opaque-host-call`, which is the arm D8 stages the query like.
`unsafe` is a PROOF in §7.5's sense on the terms `opaque-host-call` is: what is proved is the host's
own declaration that the stage reaches somewhere the host does not own, read together with the
document. `unknown` was considered and rejected. Resume-replay re-evaluates reads (§7.2), so an
`unknown` staged read would be resumed and its evaluator asked again by a strict host. That is the
re-run D34's staging exists to prevent. `Replay.admit` therefore now refuses to resume such a
handler under `Replay.strict`, as it refuses one holding a host call. Under `PureRead`, which is
absent or declared, a read contributes nothing to either posture, exactly as before. A host with no
evaluator publishes its demanded document byte-identically except for the version.

**Static agrees with runtime, and a test fails if they diverge.** `StagedQueryPostureTests` runs one
read under each posture (absent, `pureRead`, `reaching`) and compares the two sides. The static side
reads the replay reasons and the undo posture under `ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture` of the
registry the run is given. The run side runs `Durable.run` twice (did the first run journal the read
at its ordinal, and did the second serve it from the journal?) and runs `Undo.run` over
`Handler.runPlanned`'s plan (was it refused `undo-one-way-step` naming `RunQuery`?). The predicate is
that the projection calls the read staged exactly when the run journals it, and one-way exactly when
the undo is refused at it. The test also pins which way each side lands, so agreement on a wrong
answer cannot pass. It shows the predicate can go red by reading the projection under the posture the
registry does NOT declare. A probe removed the undo arm from `Undo.defectsOfStage` alone and the
reaching case went red.

**The specification moves, in one change-set across both repositories.** `staged-query` is a seventh
token in §7.5's closed vocabulary. By §11.1's own rule, adding an arm to a closed vocabulary is
breaking and takes a format version, so the specification is at **format version 3**. No document
moves. §7.4 gains the host query posture: a two-row table (`pure-read`, `reaching`) and the rule that
a host derives a handler's replay safety under the posture it actually runs it under. §7.2's
resume-replay bullet says a staged read is not a read for its purpose. §10.1 point 3 gives a handler
vector an optional `queryEvaluator` member naming the posture its derived values are read under. It
is an INPUT a reader recomputes under and never writes, and absent means `pure-read`, so every
existing vector's expectation is unchanged. §10.7 makes the token reachable at the toy subject, since
a `RunQuery`'s source and pipeline are the substrate's at both subjects.

The resident emitter and both independent emitters take the posture from the vector. The manifest
carries `handler/staged-query` and `toy-handler/staged-query`, one read each under `reaching`, each
discriminating the token. `check-manifest.mjs` holds both subjects to discriminating it, admits only
the two postures, and checks the JOIN no emitter can make for a reader: a vector names `staged-query`
at exactly its read stages under `reaching`, and nowhere otherwise. **The schemas do not move.** They
describe documents, no document changes, and the manifest has no schema.

**The demanded document moves to version 10.** No member moves. A reason's `defect` is a token from a
closed vocabulary, though, and a reader pinned to version 9 holds a vocabulary that cannot name
`staged-query`. The number is what tells a reader which vocabulary it holds. Riding version 9 was
considered, since version 9 belongs to this unreleased draft and the atMost clause rode version 6 on
that argument. It was rejected because that argument rested on a pinned reader REFUSING the new
member. A version-9 reader reads `defect` as an open string, so it would carry the token without
refusing it, and nothing would tell it the vocabulary had grown. `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json`
is re-cut at version 10, on the terms version 9's re-cut was (D42). The UI tier's emitter re-emits it
when that tier adopts this release.

**The extracted model is the `PureRead` case, and it is not extended here.** `proofs/Undo.fst`'s
`stage_defects` answers `[]` for a read, and the model has no staged evaluator. Neither did D34's
runtime staging reach the model, which still plans every read while planning. The oracle differential
therefore runs production at `QueryPosture.PureRead` and stays exact. The staged path, at runtime
(D34) and in the posture (here), is pinned by the suites and not by a theorem. A model of it would
give `w_query` a posture and stage a reaching read as `plan_stage` stages a host call. This entry
records the gap rather than closing it, because it predates the entry and the entry does not widen
it. _(Closed by D48, Phase 2212: the model stages a reaching read and both postures name it.)_

**Assumptions kept, with the evidence that would falsify each.**

- *A host runs every handler of a registration under ONE query posture.* The posture is read off the
  registry, and a registry carries one evaluator. Falsified by a host that routes different reads to
  different evaluators. That host would need a posture per source, and `QueryPosture` would become a
  function of the `DataSource`.
- *The posture is the host's declaration, and nothing checks it.* This is D34's assumption,
  inherited. A host that declares a reaching evaluator a pure read publishes `reversible` and
  `safe`, exactly as its run will treat the read. The static posture and the run agree on the lie.
  Falsified by a deployer who needs the declaration attested. That is a claim about the evaluator,
  and its route is `QueryEvaluatorLaws`, not this projection.
- *A version-2 reader is a version behind, not wrong.* The UI tier's server suites certify the
  referenced subject's handler vectors at the released `0.8.0`, which has no posture to recompute
  under. Its first `reaching` vector reads there as a mismatch, by §11.1's own account of a widened
  closed vocabulary. The specification commit is therefore pushed beside the codec but lands on its
  `main` only with the UI tier's adoption of this release. Program's toy suite discriminates the arm
  from a host-declared case as well as from the corpus, so its gate holds against either revision of
  the corpus.

**What the UI tier pays when it adopts this draft.** It passes `ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture` (or
`QueryPosture.PureRead` where no registry is in hand) at every call above. Its corpus suite reads
`queryEvaluator` from the manifest and recomputes under it. It re-emits the demanded conformance
corpus at version 10.

**Version.** Breaking, by `STABILITY.md`'s rule: two closed DUs gain a case, fifteen functions gain a
leading parameter, and the demanded document is at version 10. `0.9.0` is an untagged draft already
of the breaking class (D42, D43), so this rides it.

## D45 — A program reports a FINDING through a sixth arm of the closed server-effect vocabulary: `Report` carries the host's code and severity as tokens the host bounds with its argument policy and types with its own decoder; it is recorded in program order while planning, journaled at its ordinal and read off the journal alone; it is replay-safe and has no inverse; the outcome document does not carry it; the specification widens §5.1 at format version 3 and the demanded document moves to version 11; closes D39's deferred fifth item (2026-10-10)

**2026-10-10. Phase 2195.** D39 deferred a typed way for a program to report a finding: a code, a
severity and a message, as the host's own vocabulary types them. Without one, a host derived an
invocation's outcome from a record it kept BESIDE the program. This entry gives Program the effect.
The program reports, the run's trace carries it, the durable tier journals it, and a host derives the
outcome from the trace alone.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *No existing arm can carry a finding honestly.*
`Notify` is the only arm with a payload, and it is an outbound act: `outbound-notification` makes its
handler `unsafe` for replay and `one-way` for undo, its facet is non-idempotent, and a halt discards it.
A finding sent through it would class every reporting verb as unsafe and irreversible for the act of
reporting, and would lose the finding exactly when a refusal makes it most useful. (2) *A handler's
effect stages are unconditional.* The stage list has no branch, so a `Report` stage is reached whenever
the plan reaches it. A finding that depends on what the plan found is reported by the handler that
reaches it, or after the guard that admits it. Flow on the op axis cannot emit an effect, and widening
it to do so is a different and larger act, not taken here. (3) *A finding is a value the plan
recomputes.* Journaling it is not needed for a resume to be correct. It is needed for the journal to BE
the trace a host reads the outcome from without re-running anything, which is the phase's claim.

**The shape: a new arm, `Report`, not a reserved use of an existing one.** The alternative was a
reserved `Notify` channel. It moves no vocabulary, but it changes the meaning of every existing
document that happens to use the channel. It conflates two capabilities a gate must be able to tell
apart, and it needs a string test in every derivation that today matches the arm. A new arm is what
D3's closed vocabulary is for: the gate, the policy, the projection and both postures each name it
once, and the compiler finds every match that must. The specification carries it as a sixth row of
§5.1 with three string members.

**The host's vocabulary: tokens the host bounds and types, never a vocabulary Program fixes.** A
`Finding` is `{ Code; Severity; Message }`, all strings. Program carries them and never interprets
them. The HOST declares which codes and severities it has as an allow-list on the `Report`
capability's `code` and `severity` arguments. That is the argument policy every capability already
has, so a finding outside the host's vocabulary is refused while planning, before anything is
performed. The refusal names the argument, never the token. The host reads the tokens back through its
own types, and the allow-list is what makes that decoder total over everything a trace can hold.
`ReportTests` does exactly this with a host DU. Two other routes were considered and rejected. A type
parameter on `ServerEffect` would thread a finding type through the registry, the handler, the durable
interpreter and every caller, to buy the totality the allow-list already buys. A codec registered on
the registry would be a second declaration of the vocabulary beside the constraints, and the demanded
document already carries the constraints.

**Trace and journal.** A `Report` is gated (default-deny, capability `Report`) and checked against the
argument policy. It is then recorded, in program order, through the registry's `RecordFinding`, a
recorder of `ExtentReader`'s and `EntryReader`'s shape. Outside a durable run it answers the finding.
`Durable.runGuarded` replaces it with one that journals the finding through the wrapper every other
journaled step uses: capability `Report`, subject the finding's content address, completed value the
finding, declared idempotent. A resume is SERVED the record. A resume that would report a different
finding at that ordinal fails the wrapper's divergence check and is refused `durable-replay-divergence`.
A report is recorded while planning, so its ordinal precedes every staged call's. That is D39's
one-cursor assumption, inherited and pinned by the tests rather than proved. `Durable.findings` reads
an invocation's findings off the journal ALONE, in ordinal order, which is program order, with nothing
re-run. The outcome carries them as `HandlerOutcome.Findings`. **A finding survives the rollback**, as
`Diagnostics` and `Flow` do: it is the record of what the program found on its way to a refusal, not
work the halt undoes. A refusal is where a host most needs it.

**The undo posture: no inverse to run, so no defect.** A report moved no state and reached nothing. The
plan records no step for it, `Undo.defectsOfStage` answers `[]`, and a handler's undo posture is what
it would be without its reports. Two alternatives were rejected. `one-way` would make every reporting
verb irreversible for the act of reporting. A `Reached` step would make the undo refuse at it. An undo
leaves the original run's findings standing in that run's trace and reports nothing of its own.

**The static postures.** The demanded projection names the arm in `effects` and `capabilities`, and a
finding's `code` and `severity` in `reach` under the `Report` capability. They come from the same
argument-policy extraction the enforcement reads, so the document and the bound cannot be two
enumerations. The message is payload and is never demanded. A host's declared vocabulary joins as the
capability's constraints through `withConstraints`, so "this handler reports these codes, on a host
that has these" is in the signed subject. Replay classification gives a report no reason, so it is
replay-safe: a second run records the same finding, and the durable tier serves it. Its facet is
`Idempotent`, and `ExactlyOnceEffective` under a surviving journal: a pure read's posture.

**The demanded document moves to version 11**, on version 10's argument (D44). No member moves, but the
server tier's `effects` are D3's closed vocabulary read as strings. A reader pinned to version 10 would
carry `Report` without being told the vocabulary grew. `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json` is
re-cut at version 11 on the terms version 10's re-cut was. The UI tier's emitter re-emits it when that
tier adopts this release.

**The outcome document does not carry findings.** That follows D25's precedent for `Flow`. The outcome
document is the projection a CALLER receives, and a finding is in the HOST's vocabulary. The host
derives the outcome from it and decides what its caller is told. A required member would move every
outcome document's bytes, and an optional one would give "no findings" two spellings. A reached report
appears in `Performed` as `Report`, so the audit trail says that the program reported.
`ServerStepOutput`, which carries neither `Flow` nor `Receipts`, does not carry findings either.
`HandlerTally` does.

**The specification, one change-set across both repositories.** §5.1 gains the arm, its capability and
the rule that `code` and `severity` are non-empty (`missing-member` when empty, as Appendix A now
says), with a paragraph on whose vocabulary the tokens are. §6.1, §6.2 and §6.3 say a report is
recorded and not staged, and that the outcome document does not carry it. §7.4 lists a report as
provably re-runnable. The schema gains the arm. The three emitters reproduce four new round-trip
vectors: the arm at both subjects, and a STATE-ONLY handler document carrying a finding at both
subjects. The manifest gains them and two reject vectors, and its coverage check holds both subjects
to the arm. **It rides format version 3** rather than opening 4. Version 3 is the unreleased cut that
D44's `staged-query` opened, held off the specification's main line until the UI tier adopts this
release. A reader of the version-3 cut without `Report` refuses a `Report` document as
`unknown-effect-arm`, which is §11.1's refusal for a widened closed vocabulary. §11.1's version-3
paragraph names both additions. Program's toy suite is manifest-driven, so its gate holds against the
specification's main line as well as against this branch: there it simply meets no `Report` vector.

**What this does not reach.**

- *The extracted staging model has no report arm.* Unlike D44's gap, this one is WIDENED by this entry.
  The oracle differential draws no reporting program, and its effect mapping refuses the arm by name.
  The arm stages nothing, trails nothing and moves no state, so the model's theorems are not
  contradicted. But production's `Report` is pinned by `ReportTests`, not by a theorem. Closing that
  gap is a proof-leg act with its own prover run, and it is recorded here rather than claimed.
  _(Closed by D48, Phase 2212: the model carries the arm, and the journaled finding is a theorem.)_
- *A finding cannot carry a value the plan computed.* Its members are literals in the handler, and the
  value channel (D42) binds op operands, not effect members.

**Assumptions kept, with the evidence that would falsify each.**

- *A host's finding vocabulary is a finite list of codes and severities.* Falsified by a host whose
  codes are open (a namespace, a pattern). An allow-list cannot bound that, and the host would then type
  the tokens with a decoder that can refuse, at read time.
- *Recording a finding is idempotent.* It records a value. Falsified by a recorder that delivers. That
  is `Notify`, and a host wanting delivery reports and notifies.

**Tidied in the same landing.** `ServerEffectRegistry.withExtentReader` is removed. Nothing in this
repository or in its known consumers called it, its own comment said a host had no reason to, and the
durable interpreter sets the member directly. Considered and kept: `ServerEffect.kinds`, which has no
caller in this repository but is documented host introspection over the closed vocabulary.

**Version.** Breaking, by `STABILITY.md`'s rule: a closed DU gains a case, three records gain a field,
a public function is removed, and the demanded document is at version 11. `0.9.0` is an untagged
draft already of the breaking class (D42, D43, D44), so this rides it.

## D46 — A write whose key only the TREE holds and whose value only the EVENT carries is resolved by the domain's loop BEFORE the fold and viewed as an `Assign` with a literal; the core gains no arm, member or function, and the demanded projection names the write's namespace as it names any write's (2026-10-10)

**2026-10-10. Phase 2198.** Phase 2130 refused to view the UI tier's `CommitLocal`, the explicit
"Apply" of a buffered form field, as an `Assign`. The action carries only the id of the field it
commits. The key it writes is the `commitTo` of that field's buffer, found by a tree lookup the
per-action view cannot make. The value is the event's flush payload, which an `Assign` cannot read.
So a commit was a leaf that demanded nothing in the demanded document, although on a server-driven
channel it writes.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *The view is per-action.* `ActionWitness.View` takes
the action and nothing else: no node, no event. (2) *The fold reads an `Assign`'s value from its
literal, or from `from` resolved against the store.* `BoundedActions`' `Assign` arm reads nothing from
the event. (3) *The demanded projection reaches actions only through `Dispatch.Handlers`*, a function
of one node (`Demanded.ofTree`). (4) *A domain may build its witness per tree.* The witness is a record
of functions, so a domain can close `Handlers` over the root it projects. All four held, and the design
below rests on the fourth.

**Decided.** The key is resolved at LOWERING, by the domain, where the tree is in view. The value is
read by the domain's LOOP from the admitted event, after its trust boundary and before the fold. The
resolved write is an ordinary `Assign(key, Some literal, None)`: the core already folds a literal
write correctly, and what is new is only where the literal comes from, which is a domain's transport
rather than the algebra. The UI tier's record of the same decision is its D15.

**Rejected: a new `ActionView` arm for a flush**, carrying a key and an event member. It would add a
case to a closed union every domain matches, and move the fold, the budget, the scope check, the
projection and the proof model's view, for a fact no core consumer needs. It would also need a Program
release before the domain that wanted it could build.

**Rejected: an event channel on `Assign`**, a `from` resolved against the event. It would put
untrusted payload into the expression arrow, which is defined against the store. D42's value channel
resolves against planned state, never input. The trust boundary is the domain's, so the read belongs
after it, in the domain.

**Rejected: a tree argument on `View`.** Every domain would pay for one domain's need, and the view's
finiteness obligation (`w_view`) would gain an input it does not need.

**A consequence for the gate.** The write is resolved before the fold, so a domain can put it to its
dispatch gate on its own before anything folds. The UI tier does. Otherwise a host that admits a
commit but not a write to its key would be bypassed by the key the tree declares.

**What this changes here.** Documentation only. `ActionView.Assign`'s comment says the literal may
come from the loop. `StateNamespaceDemand.Written` no longer names the UI tier's `SetState` as the only
write a tree has, which was a domain's arm named in the generic core. No type, member, function or
document version moves. The demanded document stays at version 11, `STABILITY.md` is untouched, and no
version advances.

**Assumptions kept, with the evidence that would falsify each.**

- *A domain resolves a tree-keyed write against the same tree at lowering and at dispatch.* Falsified
  by a domain whose fold reads a tree that moved after its demanded document was computed. The
  document would then name a key the fold does not write. The UI tier lowers and dispatches against
  the same fixed base tree.
- *A value read from an event is one the store can hold.* Falsified by a domain whose flushed values
  need a conversion the store does not make. The arm carries any `JVal`, so the conversion would be the
  domain's, before the fold, and nothing here would move.

**Also in this landing: the demanded corpus is re-copied.** `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json`
is replaced, byte for byte, by the generator's copy in the UI tier, in the direction its copy
declaration states. Two vectors had drifted when the version-9 member was inserted by hand.
`missing-root-member` omitted four members where its description names one, and `missing-opaque-leaves`
lacked `values`. Each still read to the same refusal, which is why nothing failed. The copy now says
what the descriptions say.

**Tidied in the same landing.** Reviewed: `Witness.fs`, `Demanded.fs` and this record. Removed: the
stale claim in `StateNamespaceDemand.Written`, above. Considered and kept: nothing else in either file
is made dead or duplicate by this entry.

## D47 — Recursive questions over a finite relation are total FUNCTIONS in `Fuaran.Program`, bounded by the input and never by a fuel; a DERIVED VIEW is computed once per input content and journaled under `Derive` as derived, never as a read; neither crosses the wire (2026-10-20)

**2026-10-20. Phase 2220.** A consumer's change, roadmap-engine#752, rebuilt "which phases are ready" and "is
there a cycle" as one index per tree, one strongly-connected-components pass and one readiness
predicate, and reported that a Program slice of those verbs needs two constructs Program did not
offer: a pure view derived once from a value already read, and a fixpoint or SCC primitive over a
finite relation, because cycle membership is a recursive question that one bounded pass of the
algebra cannot state. This entry builds both.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *Neither construct existed.* No source under `src/`
computed a strongly-connected component, a closure or a fixpoint; the two "fixpoint" mentions
(`Demanded.fs`, `Schema.fs`) say there is none to reach. The only memo was D41's, and it memoises a
read's DECODE, keyed by the content read. A projection over the decoded value had no home: each step
would re-derive it, or the host would cache it where the journal cannot see it. (2) *The algebra never
states a recursive question itself, and does not need to.* Its expressions are the DOMAIN's: an
`ExprWitness` resolves a domain's own `'Expr` against the store, and a state witness's `Apply` is the
domain's code. A recursive question is therefore asked by a witness, in the host language, of a value
it holds. What it lacked was a total, bounded answer it did not have to write itself. (3) *752's
shapes.* `Index.cyclesAmong` is the set of nodes in a component with more than one member or with a
self-edge; `Index.survivorsAmong` is, per node, the carriers its chains end at, or `None` when one
reaches a loop; readiness over redirects is "every survivor shipped, or the dependant itself". All
three are stated below on Program, by a test.

> **Amended by D49 (2026-10-21, Phase 2382) — the relation half moved to Core D205.** The relation
> primitives below are DELETED from `Fuaran.Program` before `0.10.1` was tagged: the graph questions have one
> home estate-wide, `Fuaran.Core.Relation` (fuaran-core Phase 552, Core D205), which ported this entry's law
> set. The paragraphs on the relation primitives, their totality, their order and their home are kept as the
> record of what was decided and why; they no longer describe this repository. The derived-view half of this
> entry is unchanged and still ships in `0.10.1`.

**Decided: the relation primitives (`Fuaran.Program.Relation`).** A relation is
`Map<'N, 'N list>` (`'N: comparison`), that consumer's own shape, so its callers move without
conversion. Five functions, each one traversal:

- `components : Map<'N,'N list> -> 'N list list`: every strongly-connected component, singletons
  included, members ascending, components in reverse topological order (each after every component
  it reaches).
- `cycles : Map<'N,'N list> -> 'N list list`: the components that are cycles, in the same order.
- `cyclesAmong : Map<'N,'N list> -> Set<'N>`: every node on a cycle. This is that consumer's
  `cyclesAmong`, node for node.
- `reachable : Map<'N,'N list> -> 'N seq -> Set<'N>`: the reflexive-transitive closure from a set of
  sources.
- `terminals : Map<'N,'N list> -> ('N -> Set<'N> option)`: per node, the successor-less nodes its
  chains end at, or `None` when it reaches a cycle. This is that consumer's `survivorsAmong` as a set, and
  readiness over redirects is a one-line predicate over it.

**Totality is the design, and the bound is the input's.** Each function is Tarjan's pass or a plain
traversal, written with an explicit frame stack. It finishes each node once and examines each distinct
edge once, so it terminates on every finite relation. No function takes a bound, a depth or a fuel:
a fuel the author picks is general recursion with a guess attached, which D1 rules out, and a pass
bounded by the relation needs none. The call stack is not used for depth, so a chain 200,000 long is
answered (a test pins it). The pass counts its own work (nodes finished plus edges examined), and the
linearity law asserts that count is exactly N + E on every relation. That is a falsifiable claim,
where a timing is not. That consumer's dense diamond (200 layers by 4, 4^200 paths) is the regression:
N + E work, the same cycle set as 752's test with and without the back edge, under a generous clock.
**What "linear" does not cover, stated rather than hidden:** the canonical order costs a sort of each
successor list and of each component's members, and node lookup is a dictionary. The traversal is
linear; the canonicalisation adds an `E log E` sort.

**The order is a function of the edge SET.** Nodes are visited ascending and successors examined
ascending with repeats merged. Reordering or repeating a successor list moves no answer, so an answer
can be journaled, goldened or compared across hosts. A law pins it over 400 seeded relations.

**Laws, each against a reference that follows the definition, not the algorithm.** Over 400 seeded
random relations with self-edges, repeated edges and target-only nodes: every edge on a cycle has both
ends in `cyclesAmong` (every cycle is found); `cyclesAmong` equals the nodes that reach themselves by
one edge or more; two nodes share a component exactly when each reaches the other, and the components
partition the nodes; the order is reverse topological; `reachable` and `terminals` equal their
brute-force definitions. Probe run in both directions: breaking the pass's low-link propagation turned
seven of the relation tests red, and restoring it turned them green.

**Home: `Fuaran.Program`, not `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`.** The functions are pure and FSharp.Core-only,
which is that package's whole dependency set, so every tier and every domain can reach them without
taking Core. `Bounded` has no reader of them, and its first reader adds the reference (the rule of
three applies to abstractions, not to a caller). The linearity law reads the pass's counted work
through `Relation.work`, which is `internal`, visible to the test assembly only.

**Decided: the derived view (`DerivedView`, `Derivations`, server tier).** A view is
`{ Name; Key: 'T -> string; Derive: 'T -> 'V }`. The key is the input's CONTENT key, and
`DerivedView.ofContent` makes it a SHA-256 over a canonical rendering, the content address an op's or
a finding's journal subject uses. `Derivations` is one run's ledger, built per run beside the run's
`Reads`, as D41 builds those:

- `Of(view, input)` computes the view only the first time the run asks for that view over an input
  with that content key. The first computation is recorded through the run's `DerivationRecorder`
  before it runs.
- `OfRead(view, read)` is the same over a typed read. An UNAVAILABLE read derives nothing and answers
  `Read.Unavailable` with the read's own reason, so the commit step's refusal still names the read that
  could not answer (D41's shape, unchanged). Nothing is computed over nothing.
- The input's content key is computed once per input OBJECT. The run remembers by reference the key of
  an input it has already keyed, because hashing a tree at every consult is the walk 752 removed. The
  reference only caches the key: the memo and the journal see the content key alone, so two equal
  inputs share one computation and a replay's freshly decoded input finds the same key.
- One view name asked at two value types is the tier's refusal, never a cast.

**How replay treats it.** `Durable.runDeriving` is `runReading` with a `DerivationRecorder` handed to
the witness beside the entry reader. The first computation of each view is journaled at its ordinal
under capability `Derive`, never `ReadEntry`: a derivation reads nothing, and the trace says so. The
subject is `<view>@<input key>` and the completed value is the derivation `{view, input}`, never the
derived value. The value is a pure function of an input the journal already holds, because the read
that produced it is journaled. So a resume is SERVED the record and RECOMPUTES the view from the
SERVED input, exactly as D41 re-decodes journaled content. It never recomputes from the moved world: a
test kills the run after the derivation, changes the relation so it has no cycle, and the resumed run's
index still shows the dead run's cycle. A resume whose plan would derive another view, or the same view
over another input, at that ordinal is the divergence the wrapper already refuses. `Durable.derivations`
reads an invocation's derivations off the journal alone, as `Durable.findings` reads its findings; the
two now share one reader (`completedRecords`). "Computed at most once per run" is per process run: a
resume is a new run, and it computes each view once more, from served inputs.

**Rejected: journaling the derived VALUE and serving it on resume.** That needs a codec per view, and
a projection such as an index of closures has none. It would grow the journal by the size of every
view. And it would serve a value that a code change to the view had made wrong, where recomputing
serves the current code's answer over the recorded input. That second risk is the host's own: a view
is versioned with the host, as a read's codec is (D41).

**Rejected: routing a derivation through the entry reader.** The journal would then show a second read
of something nobody read. That is the conflation the shard names.

**Rejected: a new `ServerEffectRegistry` member for the recorder**, which is how a finding's recorder
travels. A record gaining a member breaks every full-literal construction (FS0764). The recorder is the
run's, not the registry's, so it rides `runDeriving`'s witness builder.

**The wire: NEITHER construct crosses it.** The relation primitives are functions a witness calls;
no program tree names a relation, and no arm, member, refusal class or ordering of the program wire
moves. The `Derive` journal capability is like `ReadEntry` and `ReadExtent`, which the specification
does not specify: the effect journal is the durable tier's own record, not a wire family. The program
wire specification's normative text, schemas, resident emitter and `manifest.json` are unchanged, and
this repository's codec (`ProgramWire`, `HandlerWire`) is untouched.

**Version.** Additive: new types, modules and functions, one new entry point (`Durable.runDeriving`),
and no existing type, member or case changed. `runGuarded`'s witness builder takes the recorder, but
that function is `internal`. `v0.10.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it: it opens the `0.10.1` draft.

**Tidied in the same landing.** Reviewed: `Durable.fs`, `ServerEffect.fs`, `src/Fuaran.Program/`, this
record and `STABILITY.md`. Removed: the second copy of the journal-trace reader. `Durable.findings` and
the new `Durable.derivations` would have repeated the same filter-sort-decode fold, so both read
through `completedRecords`, and `findings` lost its private copy of the fold. Considered and kept: `ServerEffect.fs`, which
this phase does not change, and in which nothing is made dead or duplicate by it.

## D48 — The staging model reaches the staged read and the report: the query posture is the REGISTRY's (D44's sketch amended), a reaching read is staged as a host call is and lands in a query slot, `Report` is a seventh arm carrying a concrete finding, both closed defect vocabularies name `staged-query` in the model, and the journaled finding is modelled at an ordinal as the entry read is; closes D44's and D45's "recorded rather than claimed" paragraphs (2026-10-21)

**2026-10-21. Phase 2212.** Two paths in the server tier were pinned by suites and by no theorem: a
read under an evaluator its host could not declare a pure read (D34, D44) and a finding (D45). The
extracted model planned every read while planning, `Undo.fst`'s `stage_defects` answered `[]` for a
read, the model had no `Report` arm, and the oracle differential ran production at `PureRead` only
and refused `Report` by name. This entry puts both paths in the model as equations the prover checks
and the differential exercises, and retires both gap paragraphs (each now points here).

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *D44's sketch — "give `w_query` a posture" —
places the posture on the WITNESS.* Production reads it off the REGISTRY
(`ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture`, `registry.QueryEvaluator |> QueryEvaluator.isStaged`), and the
registry is where the model keeps every other host declaration the plan phase reads (the gate, the
policy, the lookup, the op performer). The sketch is amended: the posture is `r_query_posture` on
the registry, the ONE fact the run and the static postures consult, and `w_query` stays the
evaluator-and-land arrow it was. (2) *The staged list holds host calls that land in a state slot or
nowhere.* Production's `Landing` has a third arm, the query slot, landed through `LandQuery` rather
than `Assign`; the model's `sc_into: opt string` became `landing` (`LNowhere | LState | LQuery`),
production's own vocabulary, and the witness gained `w_land_query`. (3) *The model had no replay
vocabulary at all.* "Both closed defect vocabularies" could not be a theorem over one; `Undo.fst` now
carries the EFFECT-axis half of `HandlerWire.replayReasons` (`replay_defect`,
`replay_defects_of_effect`), bounded below. (4) *A staged read's answer is a table; the journal
holds a value.* Production routes a reaching evaluator through `encodeAnswer` into the wrapper and
`decodeAnswer` out of it (`QueryEvaluator.through`), so the staged token's answer is the encoded
table and the landing decodes — the model's `w_land_query` is `decodeAnswer` then `LandQuery`.

**The shape, clause for clause.** `plan_effect`'s `RunQuery` arm matches `r_query_posture`:
`Reaching` stages `staged_read cap reg.r_query_stage name query` — capability `RunQuery`, the token
and argument the registry answers (production's `fun _ -> evaluator.Evaluate source pipeline
resolve`, encoded), landing `LQuery name` — records `TReached "RunQuery"` on the trail and extends
neither the store nor `ac_performed`; `PureRead` is the arm as it was. `r_query_stage` splits the
staged closure into token and argument exactly as `r_op_perform` does, the third instance of that
split. `Report f` reads `r_record` (`RecordFinding`, the live recorder or the durable one) and
extends `ac_performed` and `ac_findings` with nothing else touched; the outcome carries
`oc_findings` on commit AND on rollback, as production's does. `land` is one function, shared by
`perform` and the durable `replay`, with the query-slot arm. `Undo.stage_defects` takes the posture
as a REQUIRED parameter, as production's does (D44: a default is the gap). The finding is a concrete
record (`f_code`, `f_severity`, `f_message`) rather than a type parameter, because the theorems
about the arm are about findings.

**The theorems.** Staging: `pure_read_plans_while_planning` (the `PureRead` arm as an equation over
`w_query`), `pure_read_reads_no_stage` (the whole plan is the same under every staging arrow —
"exactly as before"), `staged_read_stages_one_call` (the `Reaching` arm as an equation: one call, one
trail step, nothing else), `staged_read_asks_no_evaluator` (the read's stage is the same under every
`w_query`), `staged_read_not_asked_on_resume` (a completed read is served, the performer invoked only
at the ordinals after it, the record landed in the query slot), `report_records_and_moves_nothing`,
`report_refused_halts`, `findings_in_program_order` (the outcome's findings are the plan's, stage by
stage, on commit and rollback — the perform phase adds none), `finding_served`,
`finding_diverged_refused`, `different_finding_refused`, `finding_unrun_is_live`. Undo:
`staged_read_named_in_both_vocabularies`, `worst_one_way`, `report_names_no_defect`,
`staged_read_undo_refused` (`StagedQueryPostureTests`' predicate as a theorem: a one-read program
under `Reaching` commits with the trail `[TReached "RunQuery"]` and its undo is refused
`undo-one-way-step` at step 0 naming `RunQuery`). Every earlier theorem keeps its statement and
re-proves; `plan_pure`, `plan_stage_pure` and `perform_spec` gained the new arms and clauses.

**The journaled finding is in reach of the durable model exactly as the entry read is.** Production
records a finding through `wrapAt` under `Report`, subject the finding's content address, declared
idempotent, the finding encoded as the value and the record decoded back. `journal_finding` is that
wrapper's answer at an ordinal `k`, with the codec (`enc`/`dec`) and the address (`subject`) as
arrows; `diverged_refusal` carries `wrapAt`'s two divergence codes (the entry-read-naming one where
the record is an entry read). The claim D45 made — served on resume, a different finding refused —
is `finding_served` and `different_finding_refused`, the latter conditional on the address telling
the findings apart. What is NOT modelled is the cursor: a report is recorded while planning at an
ordinal the model does not thread through `plan`, so the whole-run durable differential covers
staged-read programs with no report, and the finding is compared recorder-to-recorder over nine
journal shapes. This is D39's one-cursor assumption, inherited unchanged.

**The replay vocabulary is bounded on purpose.** `replay_defects_of_effect` decides the arms
`HandlerWire.replayReasons` decides on the effect axis itself — the staged read, the host call, the
notification, and nothing for a report, an `ApplyOps`, an `EmitPatch`. The op-axis arms
(`ProgramWire.replayDefectsOfOp`) and the action-axis arm (`replayDefectsOfActionIn`) are the wire
module's walks over the encoded document and stay outside the model; the differential compares the
two over the corpus's EFFECT stages. Modelling the op-axis walk would be a model of `ProgramWire`,
which is another phase's subject if it is anyone's.

**The differential.** `ToyStagingOracleTests` draws handlers under a scripted reaching evaluator
(`stagedReadCases`, eight cases, the declared pure read as the control), reporting programs
(`reportCases`, six), and runs both through the undo host, where both postures are compared under
the registry's declaration and the effect-stage replay reasons beside them; the effect-gate corpus
gains the arm and two shapes (729 triples); a new host list, `Phase 2212 - the staged read and the
report as oracle at the toy witness`, runs `durable_run` beside `Durable.run` twice over the
staged-read corpus, exercises the undecodable-record assumption on both sides, and compares
`journal_finding` with the durable recorder over nine journal shapes with a go-red bend.
`ToyDurableReplayTests`' hand-built witness and registry gained the new members. The scripted
performer marks a staged read's own refusal (`refused:RunQuery`) so the claim against the log can
stop there.

**Assumptions kept, with the evidence that would falsify each.**

- *One cursor.* A report's ordinal precedes every staged call's by the number of plan-phase records
  before it; the model addresses it by its own ordinal. Falsified by a production run whose
  `Invoked`/`Replayed` lists do not shift by the report count — the durable host's first test would
  then diverge on a reporting program, which is why it excludes them today.
- *The codec round-trips.* `finding_unrun_is_live` answers `dec (enc f)`, the finding itself only
  under `dec (enc f) == ROk f`. Falsified by a `Finding.encode`/`decode` pair that does not
  round-trip; `ReportTests` pins the pair.
- *The content address tells two findings apart.* `different_finding_refused` is conditional on
  `subject g =!= subject f`. Falsified by a collision in `Finding.subject`'s SHA-256 over the canonical
  form.
- *A served query record that no longer decodes is a refusal at the snapshot.* `w_land_query` is
  total; `plainJournal` reads such a record as `JRefusal query-answer-undecodable`, which halts where
  production's `decodeAnswer` halts, with the ordinal replayed on both sides. Falsified by production
  refusing somewhere other than the read, or not counting the ordinal replayed — the host's second
  test runs that shape on both sides.
- *The evaluator-blindness of a staged read is per stage.* `staged_read_asks_no_evaluator` is stated
  over the read's own stage; the lift to a whole plan is by inspection that no other arm names
  `w_query`. A plan-level equation would need the extensionality lemmas over the op views, which
  nothing downstream asks for yet.
- *The model's `decide` names one divergence code.* A staged call at an ordinal where the record
  holds an ENTRY READ is refused `durable-entry-read-diverged:<read>` by production's `wrapAt` and
  `durable-replay-divergence` by the model's `decide` (Phase 1980's shape, unchanged here; the
  finding's `journal_finding` carries both codes). No differential case holds that shape. Recorded
  as a known imprecision of a shipped theorem's refusal text, not of its verdict; a later phase that
  threads `diverged_refusal` through `decide` closes it.
- *A read with no binding channel.* Production halts a `RunQuery` under a composition with no
  dispatch axis (`NoBindingChannel`); the model has never had that clause, and the toy always has a
  channel. Pre-existing and unchanged.

**Tidied in the same landing.** `run` is `run_planned` without the plan and `run_planned` answers
through `finish`, which was duplicated in the durable section — one constructor where there were
three; `land` was defined twice (once in the durable section) and inlined in six lemma bodies across
the three modules, and is now one function the lemmas call; the oracle host's `evalErrorKind`
(production's `QueryFault.describe` is read instead), its hand-written reverse effect mapping
(`productionEffect`), and the gate mutant's hand-written outcome constructors (`Staging.finish`).
Considered and kept: `Undo.fst`'s five mutually-recursive lemma groups over the op views, each
restating the `plan_views` skeleton — the duplication is structural (each proves a different
property by the same induction) and a shared induction principle would be a redesign.

**Version.** Nothing packed moves: the oracle project is `IsPackable=false` and the hosts are test
code. `STABILITY.md` is untouched.

## D49 — `Fuaran.Program.Relation` is DELETED before it ships, not wrapped: the graph questions have one home, `Fuaran.Core.Relation` (Core D205); Program's tests state their recursive questions by definition rather than take that package; the `0.10.1` draft ships the derived view alone; amends D47 (2026-10-21)

**2026-10-21. Phase 2382.** D47 put five total functions over a finite relation in `Fuaran.Program`.
Its premise check read this repository's `src/` and missed that Core already held an iterative Tarjan in
`Fuaran.Core.Propagation`. fuaran-core Phase 552 then gave the question one home, `Fuaran.Core.Relation`:
FSharp.Core-only, Fable-clean, over any comparable node, with this repository's law set ported (Core
D205). Two implementations of one question is the duplication that package exists to remove.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *No caller outside this repository's tests.* A search of
every estate for `Fuaran.Program.Relation` and for the five functions' call shapes found the roadmap
engine's three call sites already on `Fuaran.Core.Relation` (roadmap-engine Phase 888), its verb host no
longer taking the `Fuaran.Program` package at all, and nothing else. Program's own tree algebra never
calls it: a recursive question is asked by a domain's witness, in the host language (D47 premise 2).
(2) *`0.10.1` is untagged.* `v0.10.0` is the newest tag, local and on the remote, so the module never
reached a published consumer and its removal breaks no one.

**Decided: delete, do not forward.** A forward would keep a second name for one function, for no caller,
and would pin `Fuaran.Core.Relation` (first shipped in Core `0.40.0`) into a package whose whole
dependency set is FSharp.Core. `Relation.fs` and its compile line go; so does the test-assembly
`InternalsVisibleTo` grant, which existed only for the linearity law's read of `Relation.work`, and the
package `Description` returns to its pre-D47 wording.

**Decided: Program's `RelationTests` go with it, after a law-by-law comparison with Core's.** Every law is
in Core's `RelationTests`: every cycle found, cycle membership by self-reach, components by mutual reach
and as a partition, cycles as the non-trivial components in order, order-and-repeat invariance, reverse
topological order, the counted work `N + E`, the dense diamond with and without its back edge, the
200,000-long chain (Core adds the ring that closes it), `reachable` and `terminals` against their
definitions, and a source outside the relation reached as itself. **One law is deliberately not carried:**
"members of a component are ascending". Core D205 decided members come out in the pass's POP ORDER, so
a simple cycle's members reversed are its path, and replaced the law with that one. That is a decided
difference in the contract, not a gap in the port, and with this module deleted no surface states the
ascending order any longer.

**Decided: the derived-view tests ask their questions BY DEFINITION, in the test.** `DerivedViewTests`
stated roadmap-engine#752's shapes (cycle membership, and readiness over redirects through the chain
ends of carried phases) with `Relation.cyclesAmong` and `Relation.terminals`. They now use a private
`Reach` module inside the test: a worklist closure, cycle membership as "reaches itself by one edge or
more", and chain ends as the successor-less nodes reached or `None` when a cycle is reached. The fixtures
are a handful of nodes, so the linear pass buys nothing there, and the test project takes no
`Fuaran.Core.Relation` reference: this repository pins the Core spine at `0.38.1`, and a test-only pin of
one Core package at `0.40.0` would split the substrate the suite compiles against for no gain. The
derived view itself, its tests' assertions and every journal shape are unchanged.

**Version.** The `0.10.1` draft (`STABILITY.md`) loses `Fuaran.Program.Relation` and keeps the derived
view. Relative to the tag `v0.10.0` it stays ADDITIVE: the module removed was never released. Had
`v0.10.1` been tagged first, this would have been a breaking change at the next version.

**Tidied in the same landing.** Reviewed: `Fuaran.Program.fsproj`, `Fuaran.Program.Tests.fsproj`,
`DerivedViewTests.fs`, this record, `STABILITY.md` and the `0.10.1` comment in `Directory.Build.props`.
Removed: `Relation.fs` and `RelationTests.fs` whole, the `InternalsVisibleTo` grant they alone needed,
and the relation clauses of the package description, the version comment and the 0.10.1 draft entry.
Considered and kept: D47's relation paragraphs, amended in place rather than cut, because they are the
record of a decision that was taken and reversed.

## D50 — The program wire's JSON syntax is Core's, CITED: a parse refusal is `malformed-json`; the wire states its own limit VALUES — five syntactic bounds at the tree wire's section-21 values and four program-shape bounds (action depth 32, 1 024 actions per handler, repeat bound and parameter `hi` 1 024, each collection 1 024) — enforced on the way down and refused as `limit-exceeded` (2026-10-23)

**2026-10-23. Phase 2259** (the device-langsec findings L1 and L2: a repeated member was unspecified,
and no depth or size was). `PROGRAM_WIRE.md` §2 adopted the tree wire's canonical discipline, which
said how to WRITE a document and nothing about a repeated member or a bound, so two program hosts were
free to read different languages from one set of bytes — the parser differential in its classic form.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *The Core pin must rise to carry fuaran-core#462.* It
need not: Phase 2228 already raised every `Fuaran.Core.*` pin to 0.40.2, and that release carries both
#462 (the repeated member, `DuplicateMember`, refused at every reader) and #465 (`JsonLimits` on
`ReadOptions`, `JsonRefusal.LimitExceeded`). `Directory.Packages.props` does not move. So a repeated
member was ALREADY refused by this host before this phase, for the wrong reason: every parse refusal
was reported as `malformed-referenced-value`, the class that sends a reader to the other
specification. (2) *An escaped lone surrogate is refused by Core.* Confirmed at 0.40.2, once a probe
whose shell had collapsed `\\u` into a real U+D800 — which UTF-8 then wrote as U+FFFD, a valid
document — was rerun with the escape intact. (3) *The corpus vectors can live wherever the families
are.* They cannot, yet: the referenced subject's families, and the two vocabulary-free documents, are
certified by a host that consumes this repository's RELEASED packages and reads the specification's
head, so a reject vector naming a new class there turns that host red until it raises. This phase's
vectors are at the toy subject, which this repository alone certifies.

**Decided: the syntax layer is cited, and its refusal is its own class.** §2 cites Core's
conformance-corpus section *The JSON-syntax layer every wire cites* and restates no row. Every
`ProgramWire.parseDocument` refusal Core classes as malformed — the repeated member, trailing content,
the number grammar, a bare `NaN`, a raw control, an unpaired surrogate, `1e999` — is
`malformed-json` (`RefusalClass.MalformedJson`), with the parser's sentence and position as the
detail. `null-member` keeps its class (rule 5 is this wire's own: Core's grammar admits `null`), and so
do rule 9's undeclared member and rule 6's `$type` dispatch. Row 7: this wire takes Core's answer and
refuses an overflowing exponent, which the tree wire's section 20 admits — the one difference between
the two syntax layers, stated beside the citation as Core's rule asks. No conformant encoder emits it.

**Decided: the syntactic limit values are the tree wire's section-21 values** — depth 256, string
length 1 048 576 code points, 100 000 array items, 100 000 object members, 33 554 432 document bytes —
passed to Core as `WireLimits.json` through `Json.read`, so each is enforced before what it guards is
read. A referenced position carries a tree-wire value spliced verbatim: a program wire tighter than
the tree wire would refuse a value its own specification calls valid (two languages for one value,
the very differential), and one looser buys nothing, because the value is held to its own wire
anyway. A constrained device that needs a smaller arena applies an OPERATIONAL ceiling, which the
specification names deployment policy and never conformance — the same line Core's limits section
draws. The breach is `limit-exceeded`, never `malformed-json`, and its detail names the limit, the
value and the POSITION: Core's breach path spells member keys, which are wire-carried, and §4.4 forbids
echoing them.

**Decided: the program-shape limits, and their values.** Read through the action witness's view
top-down (`ProgramWire.checkActionShape`), refused at the first position past a bound, before
anything beneath it is walked:

| Bound | Value | Why this value |
|---|---|---|
| `actionDepth` | 32 | The fold recurses once per composition level; 32 is a stack a microcontroller can size, and far above any action the corpus's fixtures and scenarios declare (each nests a handful of levels). At the JSON layer it costs about 70 levels, well inside 256. |
| `actionsPerProgram` | 1 024 | The DECLARED size of one handler, summed across its compute stages — what a recognizer must hold. Sixteen times `InteractionBudget.defaults.MaxActions` (64), which prices a RUN: a document may declare more than one run takes (a branch's untaken arm), never unboundedly more. |
| `repeatBound` | 1 024 | A literal bound and a parameter bound's `hi` (the budget prices a parameter at `hi`, D35), so the worst case is bounded by the document alone. |
| `eachCollection` | 1 024 | A literal collection's elements and a stored collection's declared ceiling (D36's), the same rule as the repeat's. |

The DECLARED form is measured, not the lowered one: an `Each` body counts once. The run's price stays
the budget's (`Budget.actionCascadeCost`); these bound the document, so a host sizes its recognizer
before it reads a value. The handler's count is checked twice on purpose — each compute stage alone in
`decodeActionIn` (so the action entry point is bounded wherever it is called), then the sum in stage
order in `HandlerWire.decodeHandlerJson`, which names the stage that passes it. The path is ordinal
(`stages[1].action/0/whenTrue/body`), the view's own arm names and a sequence member's index, so it
echoes nothing the document chose; `ProgramWire.withinStage` re-addresses a stage's breach from the
action's path to the handler's.

**Why limits that narrow what decodes are additive.** Every value sits above every document the
corpus, its three emitters and both certifying hosts produce, and every row of the cited grammar is an
input no conformant encoder emits. A handler declaring two thousand actions decoded before and is
refused now; before, no rule bounded it at all, which is a different language at every host. The
format version stays 3, and the specification's §11.1 says why.

**What the corpus pins, and what this host certifies itself.** Eighteen toy-subject reject vectors: a
`malformed-json` vector per Core row 1–7 at the handler document, the repeated member nested in an
opaque value and at the server-effect, client-effect and outcome documents, and a `limit-exceeded`
vector naming its `limit` for `depth` and every program-shape bound (the actions bound twice: one
stage, and two stages each within it). This host's suite adds, host-locally: every bound AT its value
(accepted) and a unit past it; the four syntactic bounds whose breach is megabytes; the stored
collection's ceiling, which the toy vocabulary of the specification does not spell; the repeated
member at the invocation and logic-tree-ref documents; and that a breach detail echoes no member.

**Not done here, and why.** The referenced-subject and vocabulary-free corpus vectors wait for the host
that certifies them to raise past this repository's next release, in the same change-set as those
vectors (§11.1's fifth artefact). The version slot is opened by the version ledger, not by this
change: `v0.11.0` is tagged, so this lands as the `0.12.0` draft.

Files reviewed for the tidy: `ProgramWire.fs`, `HandlerWire.fs`, `Directory.Packages.props`, the test
project, this record and `STABILITY.md`. Removed: `ProgramWire.parseDocument`'s route through
`Demanded.readStrict`, which lifted the depth breach back into a malformed text — the exact
misdiagnosis rule 10 forbids. Considered and kept: `Demanded.readStrict` itself (the demanded
projection's reader, a different document with its own refusal type, outside this phase's files), and
`Budget.actionCascadeCost` beside `checkActionShape` (one prices a run, the other sizes a document;
they agree on nothing by construction and should not share a walk).

## D51 — Every server-effect member §5.1 marks non-empty is held to it by ONE check: an empty `RunQuery` `name` and an empty `Notify` `channel` are refused on `missing-member`, as an empty `fn` already was; the corpus vectors sit at the toy subject (2026-10-23)

**2026-10-23. Phase 2213** (a conformance gap found by Phase 2195's worker and left alone then because
closing it changes behaviour). `PROGRAM_WIRE.md` §5.1 says `fn`, `name`, `channel`, `code` and
`severity` MUST be non-empty. The handler decoder held `fn` to that, and since D45 the finding's two
tokens, and let a `RunQuery` with `"name": ""` and a `Notify` with `"channel": ""` decode. This host
accepted documents the specification it certifies against calls malformed.

**Premises checked against the tree first.** (1) *Only `fn` was checked.* Not quite: D45 had added a
second copy of the same check for `code` and `severity`, so the decoder carried the rule twice, in two
spellings, and still missed two members. (2) *The specification's corpus can mark a vector with the
release that introduced it, and the downstream certifying host honours that marking.* Neither holds:
the manifest carries no such member, and that host's harness runs every referenced-subject vector the
manifest enumerates. (3) *So the vectors cannot reach the specification's main in this phase.* They
can, on D50's route: the downstream host certifies the referenced subject and the vocabulary-free
documents only, and the toy subject is certified by this repository alone. The two new vectors are
`toy-server-effect/reject-empty-query-name` and `toy-server-effect/reject-empty-channel`, beside D45's
`toy-server-effect/reject-empty-severity`.

**Decided: one check, at the effect decoder.** `HandlerWire.requireNonEmpty` reads a required string
member and refuses it present-and-empty on `missing-member`, the class an absent member is refused on,
with the detail `member '<name>' is empty`: it names the member and never the token (§4.4). All five
members go through it, so the rule is stated once. An empty `fn`'s detail changes to that sentence; its
class does not. The registration key keeps its own check: §4.1 gives an empty key its own class
(`empty-name`) and a length cap, which is a different rule.

**Decided: the encoder does not refuse.** An empty member in a typed value is a construction the host
made, not a document it received; the encoder writes it as it is, and the decoder refuses what it wrote.
That keeps every encoder byte unchanged, and the asymmetry is pinned by a test per member.

**Why the class is the draft's.** No public surface moves; documents no conformant encoder writes stop
decoding, which is the narrowed decode the `0.12.0` draft already carries (D50). It rides that draft.

**Not done here, and why.** The referenced-subject counterparts of the two vectors wait for the
downstream host to raise past this repository's next release, in the same change-set as those vectors
(§11.1's fifth artefact); they are prepared on the specification's `phase-2213` branch for that raise.
Three disagreements on the same question sit outside this decoder and are reported rather than
guessed at: the invocation document's `endpoint` and `nodeId` (§8.3 says non-empty;
`ProgramWire.decodeInvocation` accepts empty), and `HostCall`'s `into` and an outcome notification's
`channel`, which the schemas mark non-empty and the text does not. Where the text and a schema
disagree the text wins, so this host conforms on the last two, and the disagreement is the
specification's to settle.

Files reviewed for the tidy: `HandlerWire.fs`, the test project, `DECISIONS.md`, `STABILITY.md`,
`Directory.Build.props` and the corpus's `toy-server-effect` family. Removed: the inline `fn` check and
the finding decoder's local `token` helper, both replaced by `requireNonEmpty`. Considered and kept: the
registration key's check (its own refusal class and a length cap, so not a duplicate), and the
test-side toy codec's own `nonEmpty` (a different codec, the toy witness's, in another assembly).

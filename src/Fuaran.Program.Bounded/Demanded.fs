// ============================================================================
//  The demanded-effect projection, and the host-coverage validator over it.
//
//  The interpreter beside this file refuses a capability the host does not
//  offer AT DISPATCH TIME, one effect at a time, once the program is already
//  running. That is the right place for the refusal and the wrong place for the
//  QUESTION: by then the answer arrives as a denial in a log, per event, on
//  whichever paths a session happened to take. This file asks it once, up
//  front, of the whole tree — "what can this program EVER ask for" — and
//  answers as data.
//
//  ── Why a static walk can answer that exactly ───────────────────────────────
//  Because the vocabulary is closed and the tree carries no code. The action
//  set is a closed DU; the effect set is a closed DU; and the wire cannot carry
//  a closure, so a decoded tree's handler slots hold inert placeholders. There
//  is nothing to infer and no fixpoint to reach: the walk enumerates, it does
//  not analyse. That is a property of the design decisions (DECISIONS.md D2
//  totality, D3 closed vocabularies, D4 no foreign code), not a limitation
//  worked around here.
//
//  ── What the walk reads, and what it deliberately does not ──────────────────
//  A wire-decoded tree holds exactly THREE action slots the wire preserves —
//  `Button.OnClick`, `Form.OnSubmit`, `Modal.OnDismiss`. Every other handler
//  (a `Select.OnChange`, a form field's, a tab's) is a closure slot, and the
//  decoder substitutes an inert placeholder for it. So on a DECODED tree those
//  three slots are the complete reachable action surface and this projection is
//  EXACT.
//
//  On a HAND-AUTHORED tree they are not: a real closure there may carry
//  anything, and no walk can see inside it. That case is not silently
//  mis-reported — `OpaqueHandlers` names every node that accepts events but
//  whose actions are closure-held, so a reader can tell an exact projection
//  from a lower bound. It is data rather than a finding on purpose: on the
//  decoded trees this loop exists to run, those slots are inert, so raising
//  them as coverage failures would fire on every tree carrying a `Select` and
//  the whole check would learn to be ignored.
//
//  FORWARD-COUPLING: a new wire-survivable action slot, a new `Action` arm
//  reaching a host, or a new `ClientEffect` arm extends `wireSurvivableActions`
//  / `demandsOfAction` here. The compiler catches the second and third (both
//  matches are over closed DUs with the catch-all carrying a stated reason);
//  the first is a slot addition the compiler cannot see, and is the one to
//  remember.
//
//  ── Two placements, one document ────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A tree is only half of what a session can ask for. At the SERVER placement a
//  tree's call action reaches a host-registered handler, and that handler's
//  stage list names effects, host functions and channels of its own — an
//  envelope this walk cannot see, because a handler is not in the tree.
//
//  So the document carries a second, OPTIONAL tier. The tier's SHAPES live
//  here, beside the client tier's, because a projection is a wire document and
//  a document with half its vocabulary in another package is not one. The WALK
//  that fills it does not: it reads a placement's own handler and effect
//  vocabulary, so it lives with that placement, and reaches this file only
//  through `ofAction` / `union` / `withServer`. That split is why this package
//  still knows nothing about handlers while the document describes them.

    /// producer that wrote version 5. What a reader built before it does with a

    /// refusal at the clause, never a misreading — and version 5 belongs to a
    /// draft slot that no released reader reads. A move here would buy no
    /// reader a truer answer and would cost every envelope signed under the
    /// draft a re-sign.
    ///
    /// **The `atMost` clause rides version 6 on exactly that argument** (Phase
    /// 1982): no producer of a version-6 document before it could declare one,
    /// a reader built before it refuses a document that carries one at the
    /// clause, and version 6 belongs to the same unreleased draft slot.
    ///
    /// **Version 6 adds the undo posture** (Phase 1977), the fifth time on the
    /// argument version 3 made for the replay posture, and for the same
    /// member shape. The `undo` key is present on EVERY server tier from here
    /// on — `[]` where the walk contributed no posture — so an ABSENT `undo`
    /// says "this producer predates the posture" and an EMPTY one says "this
    /// registration was walked and no handler contributed". A deployer
    /// deciding whether a run can be rolled back is the last reader that should
    /// take the first for the second: "I could not see whether this can be
    /// undone" and "nothing here needs undoing" are the two answers that must
    /// never share a spelling. The cost is the one version 5 paid: every

    /// declare a pure read. No member moves. The version moves anyway, because

    /// with no evaluator, or a pure-read one, differs from its version-9 bytes
    /// in the version alone.
    ///
    /// **Version 11 widens the server-effect vocabulary the server tier names**
    /// (Phase 2195, D45): `Report` joins `effects` and `capabilities`, and a
    /// finding's `code` and `severity` join `reach` under it. No member moves.

    /// pinned to version 10 would carry the new arm without being told the
    /// vocabulary grew. A document for a registration that reports nothing
    /// differs from its version-10 bytes in the version alone.
    ///
    /// **Version 12 widens the policy-clause vocabulary** (Phase 2260, D52):
    /// `perWindow`, `quantityPerWindow` and `dwell` join the clause

    // ─── the projection as a wire document: reading one back ─────────────────
    //
    //  `encode` had no inverse, and every consumer that wanted one wrote its
    //  own. Two of them exist already and a third is planned, each independently
    //  re-deriving an envelope this file is the only authority on — which is a
    //  drift risk with no detector: a reader that gets the envelope subtly wrong
    //  produces a projection that looks like a projection, and the coverage
    //  verdict computed from it is wrong in a way nothing downstream can see.
    //  `decode` is the pinned target those readers can point at instead.
    //
    //  ── What this reader claims, and what it deliberately refuses ────────────
    //  TOTAL over its input: every string is either a projection or a typed
    //  failure naming the member and the version, and no input throws.
    //
    //  NEVER PARTIAL: a document is read whole or refused whole. Every member of
    //  the version is required, every member the version does not declare is
    //  refused, and nothing is defaulted — a reader that quietly supplied `[]`
    //  for a member it could not find would report "this program demands
    //  nothing" for a document that says no such thing.
    //
    //  ONE VERSION, and the refusal of the others is the point. `encode` has
    //  emitted version 4 since the declared argument policy landed, and no
    //  encoder in this package emits 1, 2 or 3 — so "read every version still
    //  emitted" is, honestly read, "read 4". An older document meets
    //  `UnknownVersion` NAMING the version, never a v4 lens applied to a v3
    //  shape: reading a v3 document as v4 would find no `constraints` key and
    //  could only either fail on a well-formed document or invent an empty
    //  policy, and inventing one is exactly the collapse of "predates the
    //  member" into "read and empty" that the version numbers exist to prevent
    //  — the collapse that, for THIS member, turns "I cannot see the bounds"
    //  into "there are none".
    //
    //  DISCRIMINATORS ARE CARRIED, NOT INTERPRETED. An effect name, a safety
    //  word, a defect token: each is read as the string the document holds and
    //  handed back unchanged. A reader that dropped one it did not recognise
    //  would silently narrow the demand set — which is a coverage check reporting
    //  that a host covers something it does not.
    //
    //  FORWARD-COUPLING: a new member, a new version, or a new tier extends
    //  `encode` AND this reader AND the round-trip suite, in one change-set. The
    //  suite is what makes that couple hold — it asserts both directions, so
    //  extending one side alone goes red.

// ============================================================================
//  The bounded interpreter — the placement-neutral core of the program loop.
//
//  This is the interpreter that runs a program tree. It is deliberately
//  independent of WHERE the loop runs: the same fold drives a server session
//  and a browser client. "One algebra, two placements" holds by construction —
//  a single interpreter, a single no-closure-invocation invariant, two hosts.
//
//  The algebra's shape — pipeline core, richer control structure as vocabulary
//  atop it rather than as a second evaluator — is DECISIONS.md D1. Do not
//  re-decide it here.
//
//  Since Phase 1896 the fold is DOMAIN-GENERIC (DECISIONS.md D18): it reads an
//  action only through a witness's VIEW of it — `ActionView`'s eight shapes,
//  `Sequence` / `Assign` / `Call` / `Require` / `Choose` / `Repeat` / `Each`
//  / `Leaf` — and asks the witness what a leaf does. It is written to meet
//  `proofs/BoundedFold.fst`'s `fold`, which was restated over the view and
//  re-proved before this code (D14, Phase 1898), restated again over the
//  fifth shape — the halting guard the second witness found missing (Phase
//  1967, F1) — before the port that added it, and restated a third time over
//  the selection and the bounded iteration D1 and D2 charter (Phase 1976: the
//  second witness's re-run found the core had sequence and abort but neither)
//  before the port that added those, with the reversible fragment of the view
//  named and proved to undo itself in the same restatement; and a fourth time
//  over the eighth shape — per-element iteration over a literal collection,
//  which lowers to the core by substitution (Phase 1990, D29) — before the
//  port that added it, with `each_is_lowering` the equation that nothing
//  downstream learns a new shape.
//
//  The case this module serves is an **emitted, wire-decoded** tree, where
//  there is **no hand-authored `update` and no message type**. The "model" is
//  the tree's *state store* (the witness's `'Store`, whose state channel is the
//  one the fold writes); the "update" is *applying the bounded action set
//  against that store*.
//
//  ── The load-bearing safety property (STATED, PROVED AND TESTED) ────────────
//  Emitted trees are **bounded**: the wire format cannot carry arbitrary
//  closures, and a wire decoder substitutes inert placeholders for every
//  closure slot. So a generated tree carries no foreign code. THIS INTERPRETER
//  ENFORCES THE OTHER HALF: it holds no closure and **never invokes** one a
//  carried action holds — it reads an action only through the witness's
//  `View`, `Lower` and `Describe` (the model's `fold_blind`, unconditional).
//  Only a witness could reach a closure, so the witness carries the matching
//  obligation (the model's `blind_to`). The only state mutation is the
//  `Assign` shape's one write; the only outward effects are the at-most-one
//  effect each leaf lowers to (K3).
//  Together — bounded wire ⇒ no foreign code in the tree; this interpreter ⇒ no
//  closure ever called — running a *generated* app has **no arbitrary-code-
//  execution surface**, which is the invariant multi-tenant "platform runs your
//  app" hosting rests on. (Resource bounds — no arbitrary *cost* — are the other
//  half, enforced by the driver's per-interaction budget; bounded code + bounded
//  cost = safe to run untrusted on shared infra.)
//
//  ── The eight shapes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//    - `Each(collection, placeholder, body)` → PER-ELEMENT ITERATION over a
//      literal collection (Phase 1990): the body once per element, with that
//      element substituted for the placeholder through the witness's
//      `Substitute`, composed as a sequence — vocabulary that lowers to the
//      core by substitution (D1). An ill-scoped placeholder is refused at the
//      fold's entry, before anything runs. The collection may be one the
//      STORE holds (Phase 1991): resolved once at entry under a ceiling the
//      tree declares, refused before the first element when over it,
//      recorded in the trace and replayed from the record.
//    - `Choose(entry, whenTrue, whenFalse, exit)` → SELECTION (Phase 1976):
//      resolve the entry condition as a guard's; the boolean true takes the
//      true arm, anything else the false arm, unresolved or errored halts;
//      then the exit assertion, when carried, must hold after the true arm and
//      fail after the false arm, or the branch halts after its arm.
//    - `Repeat(bound, body)` → BOUNDED ITERATION (Phase 1976): the body that
//      many times, composed as a sequence; a parameter bound is resolved once
//      and range-checked first, and an over-bound one halts before the body.
//    - `Assign(key, value, from)` → write the state channel at `key` (the only
//      mutation), refusing a reserved key and an expression that does not
//      resolve to a value.
//    - `Sequence` → fold in order, threading the store + concatenating effects.
//    - `Call` → the HANDLER-EFFECT ARM (below). A placement that registers
//      nothing for the endpoint gets the documented no-op this arm has always
//      been; a placement that does gets its answer folded in place.
//    - `Require` → the HALTING guard (Phase 1967): resolve the condition
//      against the store; the boolean true holds, anything else halts the
//      enclosing sequence with a refusal diagnostic and `Halted = true`. The
//      one shape that halts, and the one the UI tier never produces.
//    - `Leaf` → whatever the witness's `Lower` answers: at most one effect, a
//      refusal with a reason, or a documented decline. The fold does not look
//      inside it.
//
//  ── The handler-effect arm (DECISIONS.md D7) ────────────────────────────────
//  Recognising a call action is the FOLD's job, at every depth, because the fold
//  is the only thing that knows where in a `Sequence` the call sits. A placement
//  that matched on the action itself to find nested calls would be a second
//  evaluator, which is what D1 forbids — so the recognition lives here once and
//  the placement supplies only the ANSWER, through `HandlerArm`. What a call
//  MEANS is placement-specific; WHERE it is recognised is not.

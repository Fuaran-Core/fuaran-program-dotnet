//  no-closures invariant prevents arbitrary *code*; it does not prevent
//  arbitrary *cost*. A generated tree can still drive an enormous `Chain` or be

//  has not bounded anything — so both placements price the same way, with the
//  same functions, and a budget breach means the same thing on a server session
//  and in a browser.
//
//  Deterministic on purpose: the budget is step/size based, not wall-clock (no
//  `Stopwatch` / `Date.now`), so the same tree + event sequence bounds
//  identically at every placement and is unit-testable headlessly.

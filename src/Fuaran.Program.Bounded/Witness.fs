// ============================================================================
//  The witness contract — what the program algebra asks of a domain, and
//  nothing more (DECISIONS.md D18 and D20, docs/generic-tier.md §3).
//
//  THREE AXES (Phase 1974). A domain fills one record, two or three:
//
//    STATE     `StateWitness<'Node, 'Op>` — REQUIRED. The state the ops apply
//              to, what an op reaches, its canonical form, how a refusal
//              crosses, and which ops are guards. Every domain fills it; it
//              is the centre all three witnesses share.
//    WALK      `WalkWitness<'Node>` — optional. The read-only walks over a
//              tree: the budget, the demanded projection, the query-reader
//              census. A domain whose state is a tree it wants walked fills
//              it; a verb does not.
//    DISPATCH  `DispatchWitness<'Node, 'Action, 'Expr, 'Store, 'Effect>` —
//              optional. Handlers and events on nodes, the action view, the
//              binding store the fold writes, the client effects. What an
//              event-driven fold over a tree needs; a domain that fills it is
//              saying it has events.
//
//  `ProgramWitness` composes them, and its TYPE says which are filled: the
//  walk and dispatch positions hold the axis record, or `Unfilled`. A core
//  path that reads an axis names it in its signature, so handing it a
//  composition that does not fill the axis is a COMPILE error — never a
//  runtime default standing in for a member nobody wrote. The handler-level
//  paths that run under every composition (`Handler.run`, `ServerDemanded.
//  ofHandler`) read the dispatch position through `IDispatchPosition`, which
//  `Unfilled` implements at action and effect types that have NO VALUES
//  (`Nothing`): such a handler cannot hold a compute stage, because there is
//  nothing to put in one.
//
//  Every member is a TOTAL, PURE arrow over the domain's own types; what each
//  theorem of the fold, the budget and the handler assumes of each member,
//  and so which axes it needs, is stated in proofs/README.md ("The three
//  axes").
//
//  The small program-owned records the contract names — the query reader, the
//  host-call demand, the wire refusal, the effect destination — are declared
//  here, before the contract, because the contract is the first thing the core
//  compiles.

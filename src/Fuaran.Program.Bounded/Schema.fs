// ============================================================================
//  The static query-schema walk, and the validator family over it.
//
//  A handler declares a query as a `DataSource` plus an ordered `Transform`
//  list, and lands the result in a named slot; some node in the domain tree
//  reads that slot. Nothing connected the two. A pipeline whose output cannot
//  satisfy its reader was a RUNTIME failure — and a deliberately thin one,
//  because the engine's own error quotes column names taken from the pipeline,
//  and a pipeline is host-declared today but wire-carried after the wire cut, so
//  surfacing that message verbatim would become a payload leak the day the cut
//  lands. The refusal therefore carries the error's DISCRIMINATOR only, and the
//  cost — `UnknownColumn` without the column name — was recorded rather than
//  argued away.
//
//  This file is the other half of that trade. `Transform` is data, so a
//  pipeline's output schema is derivable from its input schema WITHOUT
//  evaluating anything, and a mismatch can therefore be found before the
//  untrusted tree is involved at all. An error raised there can afford to be
//  detailed, so these findings name the column, the reader and what the query
//  actually provides. The runtime posture is untouched: it still says
//  `UnknownColumn` and nothing more, because it is still the thing that runs
//  while a wire-carried pipeline is in scope.
//
//  ── Why a static walk can answer this, and where it stops ───────────────────
//  The verb set is a closed DU, the expression algebra is a closed DU, and
//  neither carries code. So the walk ENUMERATES; it does not analyse, and there
//  is no fixpoint to reach. What it cannot do is see values, and three verbs
//  genuinely depend on them:
//
//    Derive    the output column's NAME is declared, but its TYPE is inferred
//              from the cells the expression produced. So the column is known to
//              exist with an unknown type — not guessed at from the expression,
//              because a guess that disagreed with the evaluator would be worse
//              than no answer.
//    Pivot     the output's value columns are NAMED BY THE DATA — one per
//              distinct value in the `on` column. The index columns are known;
//              the rest are not even countable.
//    Ref       a named source's rows are host-side by design (the wire carries
//              the name, never the data), so its schema is whatever the host
//              declares — and nothing at all when it declares none.
//
//  `SchemaKnowledge` carries that distinction in its shape rather than in a
//  comment: `Closed` means these columns and no others, and it is the ONLY case
//  from which "that column is absent" can be concluded. `AtLeast` means these
//  columns are present and the walk cannot name the rest, so it can confirm a
//  reader but never refute one. A check that cannot refute reports itself as
//  underivable and produces no finding — see `QuerySchemaReport`.
//
//  FORWARD-COUPLING: a new `Transform` verb, a new `ColExpr` case, or a new
//  reading node kind extends `ofTransform` / `readsOfExpr` / `readersOfTree`
//  here. The compiler catches the first two (both matches are over closed DUs
//  with no catch-all); the third is a node-kind addition whose catch-all is
//  deliberate, and is the one to remember.

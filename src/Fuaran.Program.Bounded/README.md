# Fuaran.Program.Bounded

The **bounded program interpreter** — a total fold of the wire-representable action set over a
program's state store — plus the server placement of the program loop that drives it.

> **Since 0.6.0 (Phase 1896) this package is domain-generic.** The interpreter, the budget, the
> re-resolution pass, the demanded projection, the program wire's referenced positions and the
> signed envelope are written over a domain's witness (`ProgramWitness`, `Witness.fs`) and reference
> no UI-tier package. The UI instantiation — the UI witness, the pre-0.6.0 names as aliases
> (`BoundedActions.runBoundedAction`, `Resolve.resolveTree` over a UI tree, …), and the UI transport
> loop (`BoundedDriver`, `BoundedConnection`) — is the `Fuaran.Program.UI` adapter, released in the
> same version until 0.7.1 and from the UI tier's repository since then (fuaran#2012). The sections below describe the UI instantiation where they name UI types.
>
> **Since Phase 1974 the witness is three records** (`DECISIONS.md` D20): a required state axis
> (`StateWitness`), and optional walk (`WalkWitness`) and dispatch (`DispatchWitness`) axes, composed
> as `ProgramWitness<'Node, 'Op, 'Walk, 'Dispatch>` with `Unfilled` in a position a domain does not
> fill. Each function's signature names the axes it reads; `docs/generic-tier.md` §3 says which, and
> `docs/migrations/phase-1974.md` is the one-page move.

## What this package is for

A program tree that arrived over the wire is data, not code. This package is what runs it:

- **`BoundedActions.runBoundedAction`** — the interpreter. One resolved action, one store, one
  outcome (updated store + closure-free effects + diagnostics). It is **placement-neutral**: the
  same fold drives a server session (`BoundedDriver`, here) and a browser client
  (`Fuaran.Program.Runtime`). "One algebra, two placements" holds by construction — a single
  interpreter, a single invariant, two hosts.
- **`Resolve.resolveTree`** — the binding re-resolution pass. Substitutes every resolvable binding
  with its resolved `Binding.Static` value so a state change is visible to a structural diff (a
  `Binding.State(key, default)` canonical-encodes identically whatever the store holds, so without
  this pass a state change produces no ops at all).
- **`BoundedDriver`** — the server placement: validate → interpret → re-resolve → diff → lower,
  under a per-interaction resource budget.
- **`BoundedConnection`** — the channel glue that makes that placement *servable*. One connection
  binds one session to the UI tier's transport seam: it sequences the push frames, buffers them for
  reconnect replay, and routes refusals. No transport type reaches it, so any backend implementing
  the seam serves a bounded program with no bounded code of its own.

## Out-of-band edits

A tool outside the interaction loop — a tree inspector or editor — may want to submit a `TreeOp`
against a live session's tree rather than an interaction. `BoundedConnection.ApplyOutOfBand` is the
one entry point for that, and it is coherent **because** of this loop's shape: the session's
`BaseTree` is fixed structural state, so an op applied to it re-resolves, diffs and lowers through
the path an ordinary interaction already takes, and every later interaction resolves against the
edited tree. On a loop where the tree is a projection of a model the same edit is reverted by the
next step's diff — which is why no such entry point belongs there.

Three properties hold by construction. It is **off** until a host installs a grant policy
(`EnableOutOfBandApply`), and an absent policy refuses everything — the same default-closed posture
`BoundedServices.create` takes for dispatch, for the same reason. The edit is **priced against
`MaxNodes`** before it is kept, so an out-of-band author cannot buy work an interacting one is capped
at. And the submitter's `Actor` is **carried, not believed**: it is a claim made over a channel the
session did not authenticate, so it is handed to the policy and echoed back, and a host records it
beside the principal it *did* authenticate rather than in place of it.

The refusal is *returned* to the caller rather than pushed. The transport seam is push-frames
outbound and fire-and-forget inbound, with no correlation id and no response envelope, so there is no
honest way to deliver a correlated response from here; the caller that submitted the op is the one
holding the correlation.

## The two invariants

**No foreign code.** The wire format cannot carry a closure; the decoder substitutes inert
placeholders for every closure slot. This interpreter enforces the other half — it **never invokes**
any closure an action carries. The only state mutation is the `SetState` write; the only outward
effects are the closure-free effect arms. Together: running an emitted program has no
arbitrary-code-execution surface.

**No arbitrary cost.** Bounded code is not bounded cost — a tree can still drive an enormous chain or
be pathologically large. `InteractionBudget` caps the action-cascade size and the tree's render cost
per interaction, and a breach is a structured refusal, never a hang and never a partial mutation.

Bounded code + bounded cost is what makes a program safe to run untrusted on shared infrastructure.

## Deciding a leaf's arguments: `ArgumentPolicy`

A witness that gates its own leaves decides each one's arguments against the declared
`ServerConstraintClause` set (`AtMost`, `AtLeast`, `Required`, and the windowed clauses) with
`ArgumentPolicy.check`, which lives here beside the clauses because it is a pure function of the
clauses and what one effect carries (Phase 2440, `DECISIONS.md` D59). It takes a `WindowedLimiter`,
the capability name, the clauses, the arguments as `ArgumentPolicy.ofObject` reads them (flat string
and integer members; integers canonical only, a non-integer refused, an absent argument vacuous except
under `Required`) and the payload's byte count, and answers admit or a `ServerConstraintDefect`, which
`ArgumentPolicy.describe` spells. A witness with no clock passes `WindowedLimiter.unjudgeable`, under
which a windowed clause refuses as `limit-unjudgeable:no-clock` rather than silently admitting. The
server placement calls this same check from `ServerArgumentPolicy`, so a leaf-gating witness and the
server give the same refusals token for token with no server package referenced.

## Asking before running: the demanded-effect projection

`Demanded.ofTree` answers, for any program tree, **what that program can ever ask for** — the client
effects it can cause, the host calls it names, the state namespaces it touches — by a total static
walk over the closed action vocabulary. It needs no type inference and reaches no fixpoint: the
vocabulary is closed and the tree carries no code, so the walk enumerates rather than analyses. The
result is a self-describing document (`Demanded.encode`), not a view onto a tree, so it can be
emitted, stored and checked somewhere the tree never travels.

`Demanded.check coverage tree` turns that into a verdict against one host, naming every demand the
host cannot cover — before any event runs. It separates the two facts a host effect registry already
separates: an **unregistered** effect is absent from the host and no policy makes it reachable, while
a **gate-refused** one is present and declined. Only the second is a policy change.

**The default posture is unchanged, and strict mode is an opt-in on top.** `BoundedDriver.init` and
the client placement's `Program.mkBounded` still build a session for any tree, and an uncoverable
effect is refused at the moment it is dispatched, with the refusal recorded. That is deliberate: a
program naming one effect a host declines is still a program that works for everything else, and
refusing it wholesale would be stricter than the interpreter's own behaviour. A host that would
rather not start at all reaches for `BoundedDriver.initStrict` / `Program.mkBoundedStrict`, which
check first and return every finding rather than the first.

**The document has two tiers, because a session has two placements.** A tree is only half of what a
program can ask for: at the server placement its call action reaches a host-registered handler whose
stage list names effects, host functions and channels of its own, and no walk over a tree can see
them. So the projection carries an optional **server tier** — its shapes live here beside the client
tier's, since a wire document with half its vocabulary in another package is not one, while the walk
that fills the tier lives with the placement whose vocabulary it reads and reaches this package only
through `Demanded.ofAction` / `union` / `withServer`.

**The document reads back: `Demanded.decode` is the pinned target for anyone consuming one.** A
consumer that derives the envelope for itself is re-deriving a shape this package is the only
authority on, and a reader that gets it subtly wrong produces a projection that looks like a
projection — so the coverage verdict computed from it is wrong in a way nothing downstream can see.
`decode` is total over its input, refuses a version it does not read rather than reading it through
another version's lens, never reads a document partially, and carries every discriminator through
unchanged rather than dropping one it does not recognise. Both directions of the round trip are
pinned by tests.

Two consequences worth knowing. `None` and an EMPTY tier are different facts — `None` says no server
walk was performed, an empty tier says one ran and found nothing — so a consumer cannot read "not
asked" as "asked, and the answer was nothing". And a host that declared no server coverage is never
told it failed to serve one: the tier is checked only where both a demand and a declaration exist,
because most hosts have no server placement at all.

**The document can be signed, and the signed pair verified by recomputation.** `SignedEnvelope.sign`
signs the pair (canonical tree hash, demanded document bytes) through a host-supplied attestation
sink consumed by shape; `SignedEnvelope.verify` re-derives the envelope from the tree, compares, and
only then checks the signature over the recomputed pair under a public key the host supplies. The
envelope is never trusted from the signature — the verifier can produce it, so it is proof-carrying
data — and what the signature attests is the *pairing*, not effect-safety. Drift (with the excess
enumerated), a bad signature and a foreign key are three named refusals; no key is a fourth, and a
refusal rather than a skip. The demanded wire is unchanged: the signed record carries the document's
bytes verbatim beside the signature, and no cryptography enters this package — the tree hash is the
UI tier's Fable-clean SHA-256 over its canonical encoding, and the key and the crypto are the host's.

## Asking before running, the other half: the query-schema walk

A handler declares a query as a source plus an ordered `Transform` pipeline, and lands the result in a
named slot that some node reads. `Schema.ofTransform` derives that pipeline's **output schema from its
input schema without evaluating anything** — the same move the demanded projection makes, one layer
down, and possible for the same reason: the verb set is a closed DU, the expression algebra is a closed
DU, and neither carries code.

`QuerySchema` turns that into a verdict. It harvests each reading node's declared column names — a
chart's axes, a grid column's field — and reports the columns a query provably fails to produce, the
steps that read a column their input provably lacks, and the unions whose sides provably disagree. A
placement wires it into an opt-in strict construction (the server placement's `initStrict`), so an
unsatisfiable handler is refused **before** the untrusted tree runs.

**It refuses only what it can prove, and is explicit about the rest.** `SchemaKnowledge` distinguishes a
closed column set — the only one from which "that column is absent" follows — from one that is merely
known to *contain* certain columns. A derived column's type comes from the data, a pivot's value columns
are *named* by the data, and a named source's schema is whatever the host declared. Each of those is
reported as data on the report, never as a finding: a check that fired on ordinary correct trees is one
people learn to scroll past. Which side of that line the expectation and the source schemas fall, and
why, is [`DECISIONS.md`](../../DECISIONS.md) **D10**.

## Design commitments

The algebra's shape — a pipeline core, with richer control structure expressed as vocabulary atop it
rather than as a second evaluator — is [`DECISIONS.md`](../../DECISIONS.md) **D1**. The core's view
of an action has eight shapes: `Sequence`, `Assign`, `Call`, `Require` — the halting guard a second
domain needed and the UI tier never produces (**D19**) — `Choose` and `Repeat` — the selection and
the bounded iteration D1 and D2 charter, designed for reversal, which the same domain's re-run found
missing (**D21**; the reversible fragment, its trace and its inverse are `BoundedActions.runTraced` /
`reversible` / `reverse` / `runReversed`) — `Each` — per-element iteration over a literal collection,
lowered by the witness's substitution to the sequence of its elements (**D29**) — and `Leaf`. The closed
per-placement effect vocabulary and its registered host-performer seam is **D3**. The UI-typed first
instantiation, and the dependency direction that follows from it, are **D4** and **D5**. This README
cites those decisions rather than restating them; `DECISIONS.md` is authoritative.

## Documented no-ops

Actions with no form on the bounded path (`Notify` / `AiTool` / `Invoke` / `Dispatch` / `Call` /
`CommitLocal`) are **documented no-ops that emit a readable diagnostic**, not silent nothings. A
generated tree that *intended* one of them is observable to whoever is debugging the emission. The
no-op is the correct behaviour; the diagnostic is what makes it debuggable.

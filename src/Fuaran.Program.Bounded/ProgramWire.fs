// ============================================================================
//  The program wire — the shared half.
//
//  This file is the placement-neutral part of the codec for the program wire
//  specification: the canonical-JSON discipline, the refusal vocabulary, the
//  three REFERENCED positions the specification does not respecify, the
//  cross-layer reference, the invocation record, and the replay classification
//  of an action. The referenced vocabularies themselves — the action, the
//  tree-op, the client effect — are a DOMAIN's, and reach this file only
//  through its witness's codecs (DECISIONS.md D18, K6).
//
//  The placement-specific half — the handler declared form, the server-effect
//  vocabulary and the outcome report — lives with the placement that owns those
//  types.
//
//  ── Three properties worth stating before the code ──────────────────────────
//
//  1. A REFUSAL CARRIES A CLASS, not a message. The specification's Appendix A
//     enumerates them, the corpus names one per reject vector, and a conformant
//     reader must refuse FOR THE NAMED CLASS — because "my parser threw" and "my
//     reader applied the rule" are different facts and only the second is
//     conformance. The `Detail` beside it is for a human and is never compared.
//
//  2. NOTHING HERE RE-SPELLS A REFERENCED VOCABULARY. An action, a tree-op, a
//     tabular source and a pipeline are encoded and decoded by their OWN
//     canonical codecs and spliced. That is not laziness: a second spelling of a
//     shape is exactly the drift the specification's §3 exists to forbid, and it
//     is why `decodeAction` asks the witness's own action decoder rather than
//     reimplementing an action reader.
//
//  3. THE REPLAY CLASSIFICATION READS THE VIEW (since Phase 1896, D18). It read
//     the encoded document's tags until then — `Call`, `Chain`/`ops`,
//     `SetState`/`valueFrom` — which are one domain's spellings; the view is
//     the same four-way distinction without them. For every action an encoder
//     can produce the two agree: a `Chain` whose `ops` is not an array cannot
//     be encoded, and the classification only ever ran on encoded output. An
//     op is classified by the witness's `AbsoluteTarget`, and one that cannot
//     be encoded at all is its own defect.
// ============================================================================

/// The refusal classes, as the specification's Appendix A enumerates them. They
/// are `Literal`s so a caller can match on them and a typo is a compile error
/// rather than a silently-never-equal string.

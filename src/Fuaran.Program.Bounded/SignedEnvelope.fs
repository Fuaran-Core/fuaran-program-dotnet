// ============================================================================
//  The signed effect envelope — proof-carrying data an operator verifies before
//  load (Phase 1744).
//
//  `Demanded.ofTree` answers "what can this program EVER ask for" as a document
//  that can be stored where the tree never travels. Nothing signed it, so a
//  deployer handed a tree and an envelope held a claim, not evidence. This file
//  adds the binding: the PAIR (canonical tree hash, canonical envelope bytes) is
//  signed, and verification is by RECOMPUTATION.
//
//  ── Why recomputation, and what the signature therefore attests ────────────
//  A verifier does not read the envelope and believe it. It decodes the tree,
//  re-derives the envelope through the same total walk, compares, and only then
//  checks the signature — over the preimage it just RECOMPUTED, never over the
//  bytes it was handed. So the envelope is proof-carrying data: its contents
//  need no trust in whoever wrote them, because the verifier can produce them
//  itself. What the signature adds is exactly the thing recomputation cannot
//  give — that a named key vouched for THIS tree paired with THIS envelope —
//  and nothing else. It does not say the effects are safe; it says the pairing
//  is the signer's. Whether the demanded effects are acceptable is
//  `Demanded.check`'s question, asked of a host's coverage, afterwards.
//
//  ── Three failures, named distinctly ────────────────────────────────────────
//  A bare boolean would collapse three facts that demand different responses:
//
//    EnvelopeDrift   the recomputed envelope is not the signed one. A tree
//                    whose effects EXCEED its signed envelope is this, with the
//                    excess enumerated — the case verify-before-load exists for.
//    BadSignature    the envelope describes the tree exactly, but the signature
//                    does not verify over the recomputed pair under the offered
//                    key: the tree is not the one the signer paired (its hash
//                    moved without moving a demand), or the bytes are forged.
//    ForeignKey      the signature names a key the verifier was not offered. A
//                    signature cannot be checked under a key it was not made
//                    with, so this is refused before anything is recomputed.
//
//  And one refusal that is not a tamper case: NoKey. A verify with no public key
//  REFUSES rather than skipping the signature check — a check that quietly
//  degrades to "the envelope matches" when no key is supplied is the check an
//  operator believes they ran and did not.
//
//  ── The signer is the host's, by shape ──────────────────────────────────────
//  Signing goes through `Fuaran.Core.IAttestationSink`, the synchronous
//  attestation seam the substrate already carries: it signs an opaque string
//  and answers with a key id and a signature, or `None` for the no-op posture.
//  The key never crosses it. Verification takes the PUBLIC key as a value of
//  the host's own key type and the crypto as a `ClaimVerifier` over that type
//  (DECISIONS.md D18 §3.6) — a host supplies the pair, exactly as it supplies
//  an effect performer, and the verifier reads nothing from a key but its id.
//  This package holds no cryptography: the tree hash is Core's Fable-clean
//  SHA-256 (`Fuaran.Core.Hash.sha256Hex`) over the domain's canonical tree
//  encoding (the STATE axis's `Canonical` — Phase 1974: a signed envelope
//  binds the state's canonical bytes and reads no other member of the
//  witness), so the same preimage is computed on every runtime the
//  interpreter runs on.
//
//  ── What this deliberately is not ───────────────────────────────────────────
//  A new envelope shape. `Demanded.encode` / `decode` are unchanged and the
//  signed record carries the demanded document's bytes VERBATIM beside the
//  signature, so a consumer that ignores the signature reads what it read
//  before. Nor is it a trust decision about the key: whether the offered key is
//  one to believe — its lifecycle, its revocation, who it belongs to — is the
//  host's key directory's question, answered before the key is handed here.

// ============================================================================
//  A handler, as data — and the fold that runs one.
//
//  A handler is the decomposition every host already performs by hand
//  (validate → read → compute → mutate → respond), written down as a STAGE LIST
//  rather than as a function. Two stage kinds, and the split is the whole
//  design:
//
//    Compute a   the bounded algebra — interpreted by the SHARED fold, the same
//                one the browser placement and the server driver run. Not a
//                copy, not a variant. Since the handler arm moved into the fold
//                (DECISIONS.md D7) this package matches on an `Action`
//                NOWHERE AT ALL — the one place an action is INTERPRETED is the
//                shared fold, which is D1's "no second evaluator" as something a
//                grep settles rather than a claim to trust.
//
//    Effect e    one arm of this placement's closed effect vocabulary, run
//                through the default-deny gate beside it.
//
//  Sequencing is the core algebra's, not a new construct: a stage list is read
//  in order exactly as `Action.Chain` folds in order. What the list adds is the
//  ability to interleave the two vocabularies, which is precisely what a
//  handler is for and precisely what the client placement has no need of.
//
//  ── Where a handler comes from ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//  The HOST registers it. A generated tree can only NAME a handler, through an
//  `Action.Call` endpoint; it cannot carry one. That is deliberate at this
//  stage: it means every host function, pipeline and op sequence in this file
//  is host-authored data, so the capability envelope of a session is fixed
//  before any untrusted tree arrives. Giving a handler a wire form is a later,
//  separate act — see `docs/server-handler-atomicity.md`.
//
//  ── Atomicity, in two phases (DECISIONS.md D8) ──────────────────────────────
//  The HANDLER is the unit, not the stage. Stages thread a value; nothing is
//  committed until the last one succeeds; a denial or a failure discards the
//  accumulated store, the ops, the effects and the notifications, keeping only
//  the diagnostics that say why. A half-applied handler is therefore
//  unrepresentable in the returned value.
//
//  A run has two phases, and the split is what extends that guarantee past the
//  state this placement owns:
//
//    PLAN     every stage runs in order. A query evaluates, a compute folds, an
//             op applies to the in-memory tree, a patch and a notification
//             accumulate — and a `HostCall` is GATED, LOOKED UP, and its landing
//             slot checked, then STAGED rather than invoked. Everything this
//             phase does is either a read or a value the caller can discard.
//
//    PERFORM  reached only when the plan completed. The staged host calls are
//             invoked in declaration order and their results land.
//
//  So a domain failure — a denial, a bad op, an unresolvable source, a reserved
//  landing slot — happens BEFORE anything external runs, which is the property
//  the note's third option was chosen for. The price is stated rather than
//  hidden: a later stage cannot read an earlier host call's result, because at
//  planning time there is no result to read.
//
//  What remains, and is REPORTED rather than pretended away: a performer that
//  fails in the perform phase leaves its predecessors run. The outcome then
//  carries `Committed = false` with the store rolled back, and `Performed`
//  naming exactly the host calls that did happen — the one case where an
//  uncommitted handler reports having performed anything at all.
//
//  ── Two amendments from the second witness (Phase 1967) ────────────────────
//  A domain whose handler is a store-mutating VERB rather than a UI event
//  handler ran under this fold unchanged and found two things it had to build
//  beside it (DECISIONS.md D19):
//
//    A GUARD THAT HALTS. A `Compute` stage whose action meets the shared fold's
//    `Require` shape and does not hold comes back `Halted`, and the handler
//    treats it exactly as an effect that failed: the halt stops every later
//    stage, nothing reaches the perform phase, and the outcome rolls back with
//    the fold's own refusal diagnostic saying why. A leaf's refusal is still a
//    diagnostic the handler carries on past — the UI tier's refusals are all of
//    that kind.
//
//    OPS THAT ARE PERFORMED. Under `OpPerformance.InMemory` — the default, and
//    the UI tier — `ApplyOps` is what it always was: applied while planning,
//    and that apply is the effect. Under `OpPerformance.Performed`, the apply
//    is a PLAN: the tree moves so later stages read it, and each op is STAGED
//    as a call of its own, performed in the perform phase in plan order beside
//    the host calls. D8's law then covers the ops too, with no new vocabulary:
//    `Performed` names `ApplyOps` once per op that ran, a part-way failure is a
//    `PerformFailed` under that capability with the prefix that ran reported,
//    and `proofs/Staging.fst` proves it over the same staged list.
//
//  ── Two more from the third witness (Phase 1974) ────────────────────────────
//  A document pipeline under a server placement — a domain whose state is its
//  tree — ran here too, and found both of the above on the wrong axis
//  (DECISIONS.md D20):
//
//    A GUARD OVER THE STATE. A compute stage's guard resolves against the
//    binding store, which cannot see the tree; a domain whose bound values
//    live in the state could not guard on them, and a handler that planned a
//    banned edit and then required a check passed it. The op channel now has
//    a guard shape (`OpView.Require`): resolved through the op's own apply
//    against the state as of its position in the plan, holding without
//    moving it, refusing with its own reason as the halt's, and never staged
//    or performed.
//
//    A PERFORMER HANDED THE STATE. `OpPerformance.Performed` now takes the
//    state as of each op beside the op, so a tail that persists what the plan
//    produced is handed it rather than folding the ops a second time itself.
//
//  And the handler runs under EVERY composition, filled axes or not: it reads
//  the STATE axis for ops, and the DISPATCH axis — through `IDispatchPosition`
//  — only for a compute stage and a landing slot. A composition with no
//  dispatch axis cannot hold a compute stage (its action type has no values),
//  and has no binding channel, so a landing slot is refused while planning
//  (`NoBindingChannel`).
// ============================================================================

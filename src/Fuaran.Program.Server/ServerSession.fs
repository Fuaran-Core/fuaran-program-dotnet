// ============================================================================
//  The SERVER-LOGIC placement of the bounded program loop — the vertical's
//  missing middle, as a spike.
//
//  Two placements already exist and share one interpreter: a server session
//  that diffs and lowers to patches, and a browser client that renders in
//  process. Both run the tree's own interactions. Neither can run SERVER LOGIC:
//  a generated tree that wants to read data, mutate durable state and respond
//  has, at both, exactly one option — an `Action.Call` that is a documented
//  no-op.
//
//  This placement is that arm implemented. The loop is the same one:
//
//    inbound event
//      → G1 validate            (the transport's — see below)
//      → G2 budget              (the SAME `Budget` functions)
//      → interpret              (the SAME `BoundedActions.run`)
//      → effects                (this placement's closed vocabulary, gated)
//      → re-resolve             (the SAME `Resolve.resolveTree`)
//      → respond
//
//  What is new is the fourth line, and only the fourth line. Everything else is
//  imported. That is the point of the spike rather than an economy: the claim
//  the whole vertical rests on is "one algebra, two placements", and a third
//  placement that had to reimplement the algebra to reach the server would have
//  disproved it.
//
//  ── Where the handler joins ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  At the shared fold's HANDLER-EFFECT ARM (DECISIONS.md D7), which this module
//  supplies as a `HandlerArm` and the fold consults wherever a call action
//  appears. When the endpoint names a registered handler, the handler runs;
//  otherwise the behaviour is the shared fold's, unchanged. So a tree that names
//  no handler behaves at this placement EXACTLY as it does at the other two — a
//  property the tier-parity family asserts over the whole fixture corpus rather
//  than taking on trust.
//
//  Recognition is UNIFORM, not top-level: a call nested inside a `Chain` reaches
//  the same arm as one sitting alone, in its place in the chain, seeing the
//  writes before it and seen by the writes after it. It reads that way because
//  the fold does the recognising — this module never matches on an `Action`,
//  which is what keeps D1's "no second evaluator" true while the arm exists at
//  all. The spike's top-level-only special case is retired.
//
//  ── No wire commitment ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A handler is host-registered data. The wire carries the endpoint NAME and
//  nothing else, so nothing here fixes a serialised form for a handler, a stage
//  or a server effect. That cut comes later, informed by this spike and by the
//  demand census — not by whatever shapes happened to be convenient here.
//
//  ── Where the transport stops (K8) ──────────────────────────────────────────
//  Since Phase 1896 this module is domain-generic (DECISIONS.md D18): it runs
//  over a domain's witness, held on `ServerServices`. An event is dispatched by
//  the TRANSPORT, not by the algebra — which event a node accepts, the gate that
//  admits it, and what the rejection says are the transport's vocabulary — so
//  this module begins where an action has already been chosen: `dispatchWith`.
//  A transport's own step validates its event, answers `inert` or `rejected`
//  itself when there is nothing to dispatch, and otherwise hands the chosen
//  action here.
// ============================================================================

/// as the other placements: this core takes no transport, renderer, store or
/// data-access dependency; each arrives as an injected value.

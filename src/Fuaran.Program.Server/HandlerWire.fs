// ============================================================================
//  The program wire — this placement's half.
//
//  The handler declared form, the server-effect vocabulary and the outcome
//  report, as documents. The shared half — the canonical discipline, the
//  refusal vocabulary, the referenced positions and the replay classification
//  of an action — is `ProgramWire`, and everything below reaches it rather than
//  re-deriving any of it.
//
//  ── What the cut changed, and what it did not ───────────────────────────────
//  It changed no algorithm. A handler still runs exactly as it ran before: two
//  phases, one atomicity unit, one staged arm. What it changed is that a
//  handler can now ARRIVE from somewhere, and the consequence is a rule about
//  what this code is allowed to SAY rather than about what it does — every
//  string in a wire-carried handler is attacker-chosen, so a diagnostic carries
//  the derived capability and never a name the document supplied.
//
//  The compensation for that thinness is here too: the declared form is
//  CHECKABLE before it runs. The vocabularies are closed, the landing slot is
//  checked at decode, an undeclared member is refused rather than ignored, and
//  a handler's replay safety is derived from the document itself.
//
//  ── One structural property to preserve ─────────────────────────────────────
//  This package matches on an `Action` NOWHERE — the shared fold is the one
//  place this domain interprets one, and a test greps for it. So the two places
//  this file would naturally have reached for an action arm both go through
//  `ProgramWire` instead: decoding a compute stage's action (through the tree
//  codec's own reader), and classifying one for replay (over the encoded
//  document). Neither is a workaround; both are the same rule this repository
//  already applies to a foreign vocabulary.

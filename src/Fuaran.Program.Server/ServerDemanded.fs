// ============================================================================
//  The demanded projection's SERVER tier — what a handler registration can ever
//  ask of this host, answered once, before any event runs.
//
//  The client tier beside this (`Demanded.ofTree`) answers the same question of
//  a program tree, and it is exact there because a decoded tree carries no code.
//  It is exact HERE for a different and stronger reason: a handler is
//  host-registered data whose stage list is fixed before any untrusted tree
//  arrives, so the walk is not inferring a capability envelope — it is reading
//  one the host already wrote down.
//
//  ── What contributes, and what deliberately does not ────────────────────────
//  A handler's stages are of two kinds and each contributes to the tier it
//  belongs to:
//
//    Effect e    the SERVER tier. Its discriminator, the capability the gate
//                will be asked about, the host function it names, the channels
//                it reaches, and the state namespace a landing slot writes.
//
//    Compute a   the CLIENT tier, unchanged. The shared fold runs it and its
//                closure-free effects travel out to the connected client, so
//                what it demands is what the same action demands at any
//                placement — read through `Demanded.ofAction` rather than by
//                matching an action here, which is what keeps this package free
//                of a second evaluator (DECISIONS.md D1/D7, and a test greps
//                for it).
//
//  Two things a reader might expect are absent, and both for the reason
//  DECISIONS.md D9 gives for dropping the tree-declared result target — a demand
//  no host will ever be asked to cover is a false demand, and reporting it makes
//  the whole check less believable:
//
//    A CALL ACTION INSIDE A COMPUTE STAGE. It runs against the inert arm and is
//    the documented no-op (D7's one deliberate boundary), so it reaches no host
//    and names no endpoint anyone must serve. Its channel is stripped.
//
//    A QUERY'S LANDING SLOT. A query lands its table in the session's own query
//    results, which is state this placement already owns — not something asked
//    of anyone. The SOURCE it reads is the demand, and that is projected.
//
//  ── Quantities are priced per event, through the calls ──────────────────────
//  An effect stage spends what the REGISTRY declares one performance of its
//  capability spends (Phase 2438, D58), and a compute stage what its leaves
//  declare (D54). The document's quantities are priced per EVENT: one event
//  runs one action, and each call in it runs the handler it names once per
//  execution, so `Budget.quantityCostThrough` prices a call as that handler's
//  stages and a repeat over the call multiplies them.
//
//  ── Reachability is one hop, and that is structural ─────────────────────────
//  Only handlers a tree can actually name contribute. Resolution stops there:
//  a stage's call action is inert, so no handler can reach another, and the walk
//  needs no cycle guard because there is no cycle to guard against — the same
//  fact that keeps the domain total (D2).
//
//  An endpoint with NO registered handler contributes nothing and produces no
//  finding. At dispatch that case is `ServerDiagnostic.HandlerUnregistered`,
//  which deliberately does not repeat the endpoint back: it is the one string in
//  this subsystem that comes off the wire. A pre-execution finding naming it
//  would put exactly that string into a host's logs, which is the leak the whole
//  projection is shaped to avoid — so the silence here is the same rule, not an
//  omission.
//
//  FORWARD-COUPLING: a new `ServerEffect` arm extends the match below, and the
//  compiler says so. A new source-bearing arm in the substrate's pipeline
//  vocabulary extends `ServerArgumentPolicy.refsOfTransform`, which this file
//  reads rather than duplicating — that match carries NO catch-all precisely so
//  raising the substrate pin surfaces the addition as an incomplete-match
//  warning against a gate that runs at zero warnings, rather than as silent
//  under-reporting by a walk that quietly ignored it. Deleting the arms
//  enumerated but unused there, for tidiness, would delete the coupling.

// ============================================================================
//  The SERVER placement's host-effect seam — closed vocabulary, registered
//  performers, default-deny gate.
//
//  This is DECISIONS.md D3 as code for a third placement, and it is deliberately
//  the same shape as the browser placement's registry rather than a new idea:
//  a closed DU the program can name, a policy gate consulted before anything
//  runs, and a denial that is RECORDED rather than silently dropped. What
//  differs is the vocabulary, because a server session can do things a browser
//  tab cannot.
//
//  ── The six arms ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//    RunQuery    read: evaluate a declarative pipeline over a source and land
//                the result in the session's query slot. Reads only.
//    ApplyOps    the ONLY mutation of domain state — a `TreeOp` sequence
//                through the apply engine. Nothing else in this file, and
//                nothing in the shared interpreter, edits the domain tree.
//    HostCall    the named, registered, policy-gated escape to computation the
//                total algebra cannot express (D2). The one arm that needs a
//                performer as well as a permission.
//    EmitPatch   ops shipped to a connected client WITHOUT touching domain
//                state — a transport act, kept distinct from ApplyOps so
//                "what the client sees" and "what is durable" can never be
//                confused for one another.
//    Notify      an out-of-band host-channel message. Not the bounded
//                interpreter's `Action.Notify`, which stays a documented no-op
//                at every placement; this one is a handler's own declaration.
//    Report      a FINDING the program reports into its own trace (Phase 2195,
//                D45): a code, a severity and a message in the host's own
//                vocabulary. Not an act — nothing is delivered, nothing is
//                staged, nothing is undone — so a host derives the
//                invocation's outcome from the trace rather than from a record
//                it keeps beside the program.
//
//  The case names are the F# spelling of that vocabulary. They are NOT a wire
//  commitment — this placement has no wire form yet, and inventing one here
//  would be the expensive kind of premature decision.
//
//  ── What a denial may say ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A denial carries the CAPABILITY, never the payload: a refused RunQuery must
//  not log the pipeline it wanted to run, and a refused Notify must not log the
//  message. That is the browser placement's rule, and it applies unchanged.
//
//  A capability name is safe to record here for a reason worth stating: a
//  handler's stages are registered by the HOST, so a host-function name is the
//  host's own vocabulary rather than anything a generated tree supplied. The one
//  string in this subsystem that DOES come off the wire — the endpoint a tree's
//  `Action.Call` names — is never echoed anywhere. See `ServerDiagnostic`.

//  The query evaluator seam (Phase 1905, DECISIONS.md D34).
//
//  `RunQuery` carries a source and a pipeline. Until this seam the handler
//  resolved the source BY NAME into a whole table and folded the pipeline in
//  memory, so a host that could answer the pipeline more cheaply — from a
//  database, a file with predicate pushdown, a remote service — had nothing to
//  work with. A registered evaluator receives the source, the pipeline and the
//  bound environment (the host's named-source resolver) TOGETHER and answers a
//  table.
//
//  Nothing in the seam says what the host does with them; that is what keeps
//  this domain general. What it does say:
//    * ABSENT is the in-memory fold, byte for byte — the default and the
//      reference (`QueryEvaluator.inMemory`).
//    * The gate and the argument policy decide before any evaluator is asked.
//    * The answer's schema is checked against the statically derived one when
//      the placement knows the host's source schemas
//      (`ServerEffectRegistry.checkingQueries`); a disagreement is a halt that
//      names both.
//    * A host that declares its evaluator a PURE READ keeps `RunQuery`
//      unstaged and idempotent. One that cannot say so is STAGED like a
//      `HostCall` (D8): asked only after the plan completed, journaled by the
//      durable interpreter, and one-way for undo. Staged is the default.
//    * `QueryEvaluatorLaws.certify` is what a host runs to hold its evaluator
//      to the fold, on the fixtures it declares.

/// ── What an allow-list (or a deny-list) ranges over ─────────────────────────
/// The effect's NAMED arguments, as `arguments` below derives them. All five
/// arms carry some: a host call's declarative argument object, a notification's
/// channel, the by-reference sources a query reads, and — since Phase 1967 —
/// what the ops of the two op-carrying arms REACH, read through the op
/// witness's `Reach` (`StateWitness`, §3.1): each op's named arguments, plus its
/// destination's class under the reserved `destination` argument where the op
/// names one. Before that member existed an op sequence named nothing a policy
/// could see, and a handler that wrote files and pushed a branch was bounded
/// by nothing but the word `ApplyOps`; the second witness found that gap (W3,
/// W4) and this is where it closes.
///
/// ── What is deliberately NOT claimed ────────────────────────────────────────
/// A host call's arguments are read ONE LEVEL DEEP: a top-level member whose
/// value is a string is a named argument, and since Phase 1982 so is one whose
/// value is an integer, as its decimal text, so that an `AtMost` declared on a
/// number sees the number. A value nested inside an object or an array is not,
/// and neither is a boolean or a fractional number. A host whose performer reads a nested member cannot express
/// an allow-list over it, and will get an admission rather than a refusal — so
/// the bound belongs on the top-level argument the performer takes, or the
/// performer belongs behind a narrower registration. An op's arguments are
/// whatever its witness declares them to be, and a witness that declares none
/// gets the same admission for the same reason.
///
/// A CEILING bounds the declarative payload a capability carries — a host call's
/// arguments, a notification's payload, and, through the op witness's canonical
/// encoder, the ops an op-carrying arm carries, measured as the sum of their
/// encoded bytes. A query's pipeline is still not measured: it is a
/// host-authored declaration, not a payload, and the sources it reaches are
/// what the allow-list ranges over.

//
//  The arms the effect vocabulary already has are fail-closed and stay so: a
//  `RunQuery` the evaluator cannot answer halts the handler (`QueryFault`), and
//  a store-bound extent that cannot be read halts the fold before its first
//  element. Neither can be mistaken for "read, and found nothing", because an
//  empty table and an empty extent are answers of their own. The read this

//  run's `EntryReader` — where a host's own guard is free to turn a load error
//  into "no finding", and a protection that failed to parse is read as absent.

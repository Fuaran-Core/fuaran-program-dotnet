// ============================================================================
//  RUNTIME FACETS — what this placement guarantees, said honestly.
//
//  A composition surface that holds a logic tree wants one sentence about it:
//  how many times may an invocation's effect be observed, is repeating it safe,
//  and what does a restart do to work in flight. This file is that sentence,
//  DERIVED from the handler registration and the interpreter's discipline rather
//  than declared by anyone.
//
//  ── The vocabulary is MIRRORED, not imported ────────────────────────────────
//  The three closed sets and their wire tags below are the composition
//  contract's runtime-guarantees vocabulary, mirrored here field for field and
//  tag for tag. That is deliberate and it is the standing posture for a
//  cross-boundary agreement of this kind: the two sides agree on NAMES without
//  either taking a type dependency on the other, so neither can drag the other's
//  release cycle behind it. What keeps a mirror honest is that it is
//  CHECKABLE — the tags are the whole of the agreement, they are spelled once
//  here, and a suite pins them.
//
//  ── Delivery has no rank, so the combination is stated over the HAZARD ───────
//  At-most-once may lose; at-least-once may duplicate; neither dominates the
//  other, and a rank over them would manufacture an ordering the world does not
//  have. So the combination below runs over a two-flag hazard — may it lose, may
//  it duplicate — which IS a lattice (set union), with the empty hazard as its
//  identity. The named facets are then three of the four points of that lattice,
//  and the fourth has no name.
//
//  **That unnamed fourth point is the reason this is a hazard union and not a
//  three-value table.** A derivation that proves both hazards is a derivation no
//  declaration can honestly carry, and the check below says exactly that rather
//  than picking whichever of the two named values happens to read better.
//
//  ── Only a WEAKER declaration is admitted ───────────────────────────────────
//  The consistency rule is one sentence: a declared facet's hazards must be a
//  SUPERSET of the derived ones. A host may promise less than it can deliver —
//  that is conservative and costs only the promise. A host may not promise more,
//  and a declaration that does is the one defect this file exists to make
//  impossible to publish quietly.

/// `OpPerformer` (Phase 1980) is the same declaration for the registered OP
/// performer — the one `OpPerformance.Performed` carries, which performs every
/// op of a committed plan as a staged call of its own. One slot rather than a
/// key, because a placement registers at most one. `None` is undeclared and
/// reads as `NonIdempotent` on the same terms: a domain whose op is a
/// content-addressed write may declare it `Idempotent` and reach exactly-once;
/// one whose op is a push cannot claim it without saying so. Read only where
/// ops are actually performed — in memory the arm is recomputed, and a
/// declaration about a performer that is not registered changes nothing. The
/// slot's identity is `OpPerformance.RegistrationKey` (Phase 1983): what a
/// finding about it names, and what an operator's revoke withdraws it by.
///
/// `QueryEvaluator` (Phase 1905, D34) is the same declaration for a registered
/// query evaluator its host could NOT declare a pure read — the one that makes
/// `RunQuery` a staged arm. One slot, for the op performer's reason. Unlike the
/// op performer's, its registration lives on the effect registry, which this
/// derivation is not handed, so the declaration is what tells the derivation
/// that the arm reaches outside: `None` derives `RunQuery` as the recomputed
/// read it is under the in-memory fold or a declared pure read.
/// `Facets.undeclaredQueryEvaluator` is the check that catches a staged
/// evaluator the derivation was not told about — the same shape as
/// `undeclaredPerformers` and `undeclaredOpPerformer`.
///
/// `OpKinds` (Phase 2165, D39, F-FACET) declares the op performer PER EFFECT
/// KIND rather than once for the whole performer: an op's kinds are the
/// argument names its reach declares (`StateWitness.Reach`, read through
/// `ServerArgumentPolicy.reachOfOp`; Program's own `destination` argument
/// aside), so a domain whose vocabulary mixes a content-addressed write with
/// a commit and a push declares `write` idempotent and the other two not,
/// where one slot made it declare the whole performer non-idempotent or lie.
/// What repeating ONE op does is the MEET over its kinds (`opFacetOf`): every
/// kind idempotent, or the op is not; a kind the host did not declare reads
/// as the whole-performer declaration, and an op naming no kind reads as it
/// too. The static derivation, which is handed no witness, reads the arm as
/// the meet over everything declared (`opPerformerFacet`) — sound, and
/// coarser than the per-op reading the durable wrapper takes.
///
/// `PlanActs` (Phase 2222, D63) declares what repeating a PLAN-PHASE ACT does,
/// keyed by the act's name — the subject a witness hands the run's
/// `PlanActor`. Only the durable wrapper reads it, and only for an act the
/// journal shows attempted with no recorded answer: a completed act is SERVED
/// on a resume and never repeated, which is the act's replay safety, and an
/// act no journal holds is a first act. An undeclared act reads as
/// `NonIdempotent` on `facetOf`'s terms, so a process that died inside one is
/// refused as indeterminate until the host says repeating it is safe. The
/// static derivation reads no act: an act is performed inside the witness, out
/// of sight of the stage list it derives from, so what it claims about a
/// handler is unchanged. **A non-durable placement performs every act every
/// time it plans** — the direct interpreter, and a witness built over

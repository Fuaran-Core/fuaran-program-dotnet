// ============================================================================
//  The EFFECT JOURNAL — the durable-execution contract, as a port.
//
//  This file names a CONTRACT, never an engine. Durable execution is a
//  well-understood discipline with several implementations, and what they share
//  is exactly two obligations:
//
//    DETERMINISTIC REPLAY   re-running a program from its entry state
//                           reproduces every step it took.
//    EFFECT JOURNALING      the steps a re-run cannot reproduce — the ones
//                           whose result came from outside — are RECORDED, and
//                           a re-run reads the record instead of repeating the
//                           step.
//
//  Nothing below names a product, a protocol or a hosted service, and nothing
//  should be added that does: the whole value of writing the contract down is
//  that a host may satisfy it with a table, a log file, or somebody else's
//  workflow engine, and this placement cannot tell which.
//
//  ── Two records per step, not one ───────────────────────────────────────────
//  A step is journaled TWICE: `Attempted` before the effect runs and
//  `Completed` / `Refused` after it returns. One record would be enough if a
//  crash could not land between the effect and the write — and that is exactly
//  where a crash can land, because the effect commits in a system this host does
//  not own and the journal is a second system.
//
//  So the three readable states of a step are:
//
//    nothing recorded          the effect never ran. Run it.
//    `Attempted` + a result    the effect ran and its answer is known. SERVE the
//                              answer; do not run it again.
//    `Attempted` alone         INDETERMINATE. The effect may have run and may
//                              not, and no amount of engineering here can tell
//                              the difference — the record and the effect are
//                              not one transaction.
//
//  The third state is not a defect in this design; it is where "exactly once"
//  genuinely ends, and `Facets.fs` beside this file is the vocabulary for saying
//  so out loud rather than rounding it up.
//
//  ── What a journal entry may carry ──────────────────────────────────────────
//  The same rule the rest of this placement keeps: the CAPABILITY, never the
//  payload. An entry names the step's ordinal and its derived capability, and
//  carries the effect's own RESULT because a replay has to serve it — that value
//  is the host performer's answer, of the same class as the reason text a
//  `PerformFailed` already surfaces verbatim. A journal never records a
//  handler's arguments, a pipeline, or an endpoint.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
//  OPERATOR CONTROLS — suspend, throttle, revoke and resume, as RECORDED OPS.
//
//  `InteractionBudget` refuses a single interaction that costs too much, and the
//  journal above records the one arm that reaches outside. Neither of them can
//  halt a session that is already running, slow one effect kind, or withdraw a
//  performer while a handler is live — the three acts an operator reaches for
//  first, and the three a kill-switch obligation asks for by name.
//
//  This section is those acts. What makes them cheap is that nothing new has to
//  be invented to carry them: a bounded, journalled program already records what
//  it did, so a suspension is a POSITION on a stream, a resumption is a replay
//  from it, and a revocation is a registry edit the gate already consults before
//  every performer.
//
//  ── Why ops and not calls ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  An imperative "suspend this session" leaves a running process in a different
//  state and nothing else. It cannot be replayed, so a resumed session does not
//  know it was ever stopped; it cannot be audited, so "what did the AI do" omits
//  the part where somebody stopped it; and it cannot be shown monotone, because
//  there is no record to be monotone over.
//
//  Recording the act instead buys all three from one mechanism. `Controls.fold`
//  below is a pure function of the stream, so the state a resume reaches is the
//  state any reader of the same prefix reaches; the stream is the audit trail;
//  and the revocation arm of `Controls.step` never removes from `Revoked`, which
//  is a property of six lines rather than a promise about a lifetime.
//
//  ── One op, two raisers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A machine-raised suspend and an operator-raised one are THE SAME OP with a
//  different `ControlActor`. That is a deliberate constraint rather than a
//  convenience: two mechanisms would mean two fold rules, two audit vocabularies
//  and two places for a future control to be added to only one of. An automated
//  raiser — a denial-pattern detector, a spend guard — records
//  `ControlActor.machine`; a human records `ControlActor.operator`; every rule
//  below reads them identically, and only the record says which.
//
//  ── What the stream is scoped to ────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A SESSION, where an `EffectJournal` entry is scoped to an INVOCATION. The two
//  keys are kept apart rather than collapsed because an operator suspends a
//  session, not a handler call: filing a suspend under one invocation id would
//  make it invisible to the next one, which is the opposite of what a kill
//  switch is for. That is also why this is a second port beside `EffectJournal`
//  rather than a field added to it — the shapes agree, the keys do not, and a
//  host may satisfy one with storage it would not choose for the other.
//
//  ── What a control record may carry ─────────────────────────────────────────
//  The same rule as everything else in this placement: the CAPABILITY and the
//  host's own vocabulary, never a payload. A revoke names the performer (the
//  host's own registration key, or `OpPerformance.RegistrationKey` for the op
//  performer — Phase 1983), a throttle names the capability, and the reason
//  is the raiser's own text of the same class as a `PerformFailed` reason. No
//  arguments, no pipeline, no endpoint.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
//  The undo posture, and the undo run (Phase 1977, DECISIONS.md D22).
//
//  `Replay.fs` beside this file answers "may this handler be re-run" from its
//  declared form. This file answers the other question a deployer asks before
//  a program runs: "if it runs, can it be undone — and up to where?" Four
//  answers, read off the stages and the state witness's `Undo` member:
//
//    reversible    every edit has an EXACT inverse, every compute stage is in
//                  the fold's reversible fragment, nothing reaches the world:
//                  the run can be undone to the byte;
//    compensable   every edit has an inverse or a DECLARED compensation (a
//                  saga): the run can be undone in effect, not in history;
//    one-way       a step has neither — a publish with no retraction, a host
//                  call, a notification — and the first such stage is named:
//                  everything before it can still be undone, nothing after;
//    unknown       a place this classification does not decide: a patch the
//                  host applies after return, a compute stage outside the
//                  reversible fragment.
//
//  ── Why reversible versus compensable is the line that matters ─────────────
//  Both can be undone. The difference is the LAW: an inverse obeys one (K9 —
//  applied to the state the op produced, it restores the state the op was
//  applied to, byte for byte), and a compensation obeys none. So a reversible
//  plan can be CHECKED before anything performs — the inverses are folded
//  against the recorded entry state, and a witness whose inverse breaks the
//  law is refused rather than performed — where a compensable plan reaches
//  whatever its compensations reach, and the posture says so by its name. A
//  deployer who reads `reversible` is being told the undo is verifiable; one
//  who reads `compensable` is being told it is declared.
//
//  ── The run is a HANDLER run ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  The inverse plan is one `ApplyOps` effect run through `Handler.runWith`:
//  the same gate decides `ApplyOps`, the same argument policy bounds every
//  inverse's reach, the same registered performers perform them, and the
//  same two-phase staging holds — so a failed undo step reports how far it got
//  in the `PerformFailed` vocabulary because `residual_is_prefix` is a
//  theorem about this run too (`undo_residual_is_prefix`, proofs/Undo.fst).
//  Then the compute stages' binding writes are reversed by the fold's own
//  inverse (Phase 1976, `BoundedActions.reverse` over each stage's trace), in
//  reverse stage order. The posture's soundness — a plan read `reversible`
//  is undone to the entry state — is `undo_run_restores`.
//
//  ── What is deliberately NOT undone ─────────────────────────────────────────
//  A server read lands a table in a query slot of the binding store. Under the
//  in-memory fold, or an evaluator its host declares a pure read, it is a
//  read: it reaches nothing and the slot is the host's cache, which the
//  re-resolution of a restored tree still reads. The undo leaves it as the
//  run left it, and such a read contributes no reason to the posture. A
//  deployer reading `reversible` reads it of the state axis, the world and the
//  fold's writes; a landed read is none of those.
//
//  A read the host could NOT declare a pure read is staged like a host call
//  (D34): the run records it as `Reached` and the undo refuses there. The
//  posture says so before the run, as `staged-query`, read off the host's
//  declared query posture (D44) — the one input to this classification that
//  is not the declared form.

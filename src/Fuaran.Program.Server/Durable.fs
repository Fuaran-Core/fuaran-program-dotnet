// ============================================================================
//  The DURABLE-EXECUTION interpreter — the second interpreter of the SAME
//  server-placement algebra.
//
//  The claim the whole vertical rests on is "one algebra, several placements".
//  A second INTERPRETER is the sharper form of the same claim, and it is sharper
//  precisely because it is easy to fake: two interpreters that share a
//  vocabulary and nothing else prove nothing at all. So this one does not fork
//  the fold, and it does not fork the handler either.
//
//  ── What is second, and what is shared ──────────────────────────────────────
//  Shared, and not copied: the bounded fold (a `Compute` stage is interpreted by
//  the same `BoundedActions` every placement runs), the closed effect vocabulary
//  (`ServerEffect`), the default-deny gate, the two-phase staging that decides
//  what a handler commits (D8), and the stage fold itself — `Handler.run`. This
//  file CALLS that fold rather than reproducing it, which is why the parity
//  claim beside it is structural rather than a coincidence two implementations
//  are asked to maintain.
//
//  Second, and genuinely different: what a host call MEANS the second time the
//  same invocation runs. Under the direct interpreter it means "call the
//  performer". Under this one it means "read the journal; call the performer
//  only if the journal has nothing to say" — which is the durable-execution
//  contract, and the whole of what this file adds.
//
//  ── The contract, named; no engine, named ───────────────────────────────────
//  Deterministic replay plus effect journaling. Re-running an invocation from
//  its entry state recomputes every step it took, and the steps a re-run cannot
//  recompute — the ones whose answer came from outside — are served from the
//  journal instead of being repeated. Nothing here names a product, a protocol
//  or a hosted service, and nothing should: a host may satisfy the port in
//  `Journal.fs` with a table, a log file, or somebody else's workflow engine,
//  and this interpreter cannot tell which.
//
//  ── Every arm that reaches outside is journaled ─────────────────────────────
//  D12 first put it as "only the host call", on D8's premise: a query reads, an
//  op edits an in-memory tree the caller may discard, and a patch and a
//  notification accumulate as values the caller performs after the handler
//  returns — none of them performed by the handler at all, so none of them can
//  be "performed twice" by a re-run; they are RECOMPUTED, deterministically,
//  from the entry state. That premise is still true of the reads and the
//  accumulating arms, and it is what makes the replay discipline worth having
//  rather than an extra ledger to keep. It stopped being true of `ApplyOps` the
//  moment D19 gave ops a registered performer: under `OpPerformance.Performed`
//  every op of a committed plan is staged as a call of its own and performed in
//  the perform phase beside the host calls, and a performed op reaches outside
//  exactly as a host call does. So the premise is restated (D23): what is
//  journaled is every arm that REACHES OUTSIDE — the host call, and the op
//  stage where a performer is registered — and under `InMemory` nothing is
//  performed and nothing new is journaled.
//
//  An op stage's entry is filed under `ApplyOps` with the op's content address
//  as its SUBJECT (`JournalEntry.Subject`): the capability says which arm ran
//  at an ordinal, the subject says which op, and the divergence check reads
//  both. The state handed beside the op is never the subject — it is the
//  planned state, recomputed on replay, not the thing performed.
//
//  ── The plan's ENTRY READ is journaled too (Phase 2165, D39) ────────────────
//  "Recomputed, deterministically, from the entry state" has a premise of its
//  own: that the plan reads nothing but the entry state. A verb whose plan
//  reads the WORLD — a store its state witness's `Apply` consults before
//  deciding what to perform — breaks it the moment its own perform phase
//  moves what it read: killed after the op and re-entered, the re-plan reads
//  the moved world, plans differently, and reaches the journaled stages
//  never, or holding other calls. Phase 1905 (a staged query) and Phase 1991
//  (a store-bound `Each`'s extent) already journal two plan-phase reads at
//  their ordinals through this file's one wrapper; the entry read is the
//  third, for the read a domain performs inside its own witness: `runReading`
//  hands the witness an `EntryReader` bound to this run, the read is
//  journaled under `ReadEntry` with the read's name as its subject and the
//  value the host answered as its completed value, and a replay is SERVED
//  that value and consults the live world for none of it. A resumed plan
//  therefore observes what the dead run's entry saw, so it stages the same
//  calls and the journaled stages are served; and a resume whose plan would
//  read something else at that ordinal is refused under
//  `durable-entry-read-diverged`, naming the read, before any stage.
//
//  ── A reported FINDING is journaled too (Phase 2195, D45) ──────────────────
//  A `Report` is not an act, so it could be recomputed from the entry state
//  as a notification is. It is journaled anyway, at its ordinal under
//  `Report` with the finding's content address as its subject and the
//  finding as its completed value, because the journal is the trace a host
//  derives an invocation's outcome from: `Durable.findings` reads an
//  invocation's findings off the journal ALONE, in program order, without
//  re-running anything and without a record kept beside the program. A
//  resume is SERVED the recorded finding, and one that would report a
//  different finding at that ordinal is the divergence the wrapper refuses.
//
//  ── A DERIVED VIEW is journaled as derived (Phase 2220, D47) ───────────────
//  A projection the plan computes from a value it holds — an index over the
//  relation it read — is neither a read nor an act. `runDeriving` hands the
//  witness a `DerivationRecorder` beside its entry reader: the run computes
//  each view once per input content, and the first computation is journaled
//  at its ordinal under `Derive`, the subject `<view>@<input key>`, the value
//  the derivation and never the view. A resume is served the record and
//  recomputes the view from the SERVED input; `Durable.derivations` reads the
//  run's derivations off the journal alone.
//
//  The consequence a reader should carry away is the one the facets state: this
//  interpreter's exactly-once claim is about what IT performs — and, since
//  Phase 2165, about what its plan READ. What a caller does with a returned
//  notification is the caller's own delivery posture, and the composition
//  joins the two.
//
//  ── The step ordinal is DERIVED from the fold, not declared ─────────────────
//  A journal entry is addressed by the ordinal of the performer invocation
//  within the invocation — zero for the first call the perform phase makes,
//  host call or op stage, one for the next. That is well defined because the
//  plan phase is deterministic: the same handler against the same entry store
//  stages the same calls in the same order, so a replay reaches ordinal *n*
//  holding the same call the recorded run held there.
//
//  "Well defined because the plan phase is deterministic" is a premise, and a
//  premise a `RunQuery` can break — its rows come from outside and may have
//  moved, so a `Compute` stage branching on them could stage a different call
//  list. That is why every entry records its CAPABILITY and every replay checks
//  it: a replay that finds a different capability at an ordinal REFUSES rather
//  than serving one call's answer to another. Divergence is a real hazard of
//  every replay-based engine; what is not acceptable is discovering it by
//  delivering the wrong result.

//  A DERIVED VIEW is computed once per input value and journaled AS DERIVED

// ============================================================================
//  The OPERATOR CONTROLS, wired to this interpreter.
//
//  The vocabulary and the fold are in `Journal.fs` beside the effect journal,
//  because they are a durability contract and not an interpreter. This section
//  is the other half: what a folded `ControlState` MEANS to a running session.
//
//  ── Nothing above this line changed ─────────────────────────────────────────
//  `Durable.run`, `Durable.arm` and `Durable.step` are untouched, and the
//  controls-aware forms below CALL them rather than reproducing them — the same
//  discipline D12 records for the two interpreters, one level down. A control
//  takes effect by wrapping the REGISTRY the run is handed, which is the one
//  place every effect already passes through — and, since Phase 1983, by
//  handing the run the op stage's refusal, because the one performer the
//  registry does NOT hold is the op performer. Until then "there is no arm a
//  control can be forgotten for" was true of every arm but that one: an
//  operator who revoked every host performer still had ops performed (D23's
//  finding, closed by D26). `runGuarded` / `armGuarded` are the uncontrolled
//  forms with that one hook exposed, so the controlled forms still call the
//  interpreter rather than reproducing it.
//
//  ── Where each act lands ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  Three of the four land at the effect gate and are `Controls.apply`'s work —
//  a revoke of the op performer (`OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`) excepted,
//  which lands at the op STAGE, before the stage is attempted
//  (`Controls.opStageRefusal`).
//  The fourth — the suspend's "refuse every dispatch" — lands one level up, at
//  the session's own G1 gate, because a dispatch is refused before a handler is
//  reached and therefore before any registry is consulted. `stepControlled`
//  expresses it by closing `ServerServices.CanDispatch`, which is the gate the
//  loop already asks, so a suspended step is refused through the SAME path and
//  with the same `ServerReject.Gate` shape as any other policy refusal. No new
//  refusal type, and nothing for a host's existing rejection handling to learn.
//
//  A suspension refuses a DISPATCH. An event carrying no action dispatches
//  nothing, so it stays inert rather than being refused — that is the honest
//  reading of the word, and the alternative would have a suspended session
//  reporting refusals of things nobody asked it to do.
//
//  ── Why resume needs no resume ENGINE ───────────────────────────────────────
//  Because the suspend performed nothing. A refused dispatch leaves the session
//  value untouched, so the continuation after a `Resume` is the continuation the
//  uninterrupted session would have had — not reconstructed, the same value. The
//  case that DOES need replay is a suspend raised across a live invocation, and
//  that is the durable interpreter's existing job: the resumed run re-reads the
//  journal, serves every recorded step and re-invokes none of them. So the
//  controls add a decision and no second replay path, which is the whole reason
//  they were worth expressing as journal ops.

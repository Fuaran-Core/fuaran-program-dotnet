// ============================================================================
//  The client host-effect seam — closed vocabulary, registered performers,
//  default-deny gate.
//
//  This is DECISIONS.md D3 as code, for the browser placement. Read it there
//  rather than re-deriving it here; what this file adds is the mechanism:
//
//    - The effect vocabulary is a CLOSED DU — a domain's, reached through its
//      effect witness (DECISIONS.md D18): the witness names each effect's
//      discriminator and its destination. A program tree can *name* only what
//      that DU can express, and nothing on the wire widens it.
//    - Extensibility is a HOST act: an embedding host registers a named
//      performer. Until it does, the effect has nowhere to go.
//    - Every dispatch passes a policy gate FIRST. The gate defaults to refusing
//      everything, so a host that registers nothing performs nothing — the same
//      posture the dispatch gate and the server placement's services take.
//    - A refusal is RECORDED, never silently dropped. "Nothing happened" and
//      "the host refused that" are different facts, and a generated app being
//      debugged needs to tell them apart.
//
//  The server placement reaches the same vocabulary through a different
//  transport: it ships the same effects to a browser shim that performs them.
//  One effect vocabulary, two transports — so a host registering performers
//  here should match the shim's behaviour arm for arm, and the parity family
//  asserts it where the behaviour is observable.
// ============================================================================

// ─── Destination policy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  The gate above takes the effect's DISCRIMINATOR, and that is all it can
//  ever see. It answers "may this host navigate at all", which is a real
//  question and not the whole one: a host that allows `Navigate` allows
//  navigation to ANYWHERE, and `Download` of anything from anywhere. The
//  discriminator carries no destination, so no policy expressed over it can
//  distinguish "go to our own checkout page" from "go to an attacker's
//  collector with the session in the query string".
//
//  So a second, typed policy sits beside the gate and is consulted WITH the
//  payload's destination. Two gates, two questions, both positive lists: the
//  discriminator gate says WHAT the host does, the destination policy says
//  WHERE it may do it. Neither substitutes for the other, and the ordering is
//  load-bearing — an effect the host does not do at all is refused before its
//  destination is even parsed.
//
//  **Why the origin machinery is expressed here rather than imported.** The
//  scheme floor is the DOMAIN's — handed to `EgressPolicy.classifyWith` by the
//  witness that owns it (the UI tier's renderer URL floor, for the UI witness)
//  — because it decides whether a URL is safe to have, and duplicating that
//  would be a second implementation of a security decision. What is local is
//  the ORIGIN
//  extraction and the allowlist, because the UI tier's matching form arrived in
//  a version this repo does not pin (DECISIONS.md D4's deliberate lag: the pin
//  is a visible decision, not drift). The two are written to the same rules —
//  host only, no scheme and no path, label-boundary suffix matching, userinfo
//  discarded at the LAST `@` — and they collapse to a re-export the moment the
//  pin advances.

/// One allowed destination. Hosts only — no scheme, no port, no path.
///
/// Scheme is deliberately absent: the floor has already reduced it to the
/// allowlisted set, and every "scheme wildcard" spelling parses differently on
/// different hosts, which makes the wildcard itself the vulnerability. Path is
/// deliberately absent too: a path is not a security boundary, and a policy
/// that looks like it bounds one invites reliance on a bound it does not have.

    /// harness (which compares it).
    ///
    /// The order is load-bearing at three points, and each one is a decision
    /// rather than an accident:
    ///
    ///   1. registration, then policy, then the performer — no performer
    ///      side-effect can precede a policy decision, because the performer is
    ///      never even looked up as a callable until both gates have spoken;
    ///   2. the DISCRIMINATOR gate before the DESTINATION policy — an effect
    ///      this host does not perform at all is refused before its payload is
    ///      parsed, so a malformed URL in an effect nobody permits produces the
    ///      refusal the host would expect rather than a parse-shaped one;
    ///   3. exactly one denial per dispatch. A refusal records the FIRST reason
    ///      it met, not every reason that would have applied — "the gate
    ///      refused it" and "the destination was undeclared" are answers to
    ///      different questions, and emitting both would make a log read as two
    ///      attempts.

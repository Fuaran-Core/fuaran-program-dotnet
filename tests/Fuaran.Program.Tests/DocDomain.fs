/// the shape the third instantiation measured: a typed tree whose bound values
/// live INSIDE the document (its context), node ids that are typed and have a
/// faithful string form (K1), an op algebra whose rejection is typed and
/// crosses the op channel as canonical JSON (W5), no events and no handlers on
/// any node, a pack-style guard, and a tail that renders the document and
/// commits the ops.
///
/// It fills the STATE axis and the WALK axis, and no dispatch axis:
/// `ProgramWitness<Document, DocStep, WalkWitness<Document>, Unfilled>`. The
/// walk is real — the tree has children the budget can price — and nothing
/// is dispatched from a node. Its guard is an op (`RequirePack`), which the
/// state witness views as a guard, so it reads the document AS PLANNED; its
/// performer is handed that document, so the tail renders and commits what
/// the plan produced without folding the ops a second time (`DECISIONS.md`
/// D20, F-GUARD and F-PERFORM).

/// Since Phase 1974 it fills the STATE AXIS ONLY (`DECISIONS.md` D20): a verb
/// has no events, no node tree to walk and no binding store, so its
/// composition is `ProgramWitness<FileMap, FileOp, Unfilled, Unfilled>` — six
/// members, where 0.7.0 asked it for thirty-two and found twenty-five of them
/// vacuous. Its guards are ops (`Check`), which the state witness VIEWS as
/// guards: resolved against the plan as of their position, never performed —
/// the shape the first second witness reached for before Program had one.

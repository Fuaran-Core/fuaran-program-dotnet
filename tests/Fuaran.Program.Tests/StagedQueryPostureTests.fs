module Fuaran.Program.Tests.StagedQueryPostureTests

// ============================================================================
//  The static postures name a staged query evaluator (Phase 2187,
//  DECISIONS.md D44), at the toy witness.
//
//  D34 staged a read whose evaluator its host could not declare a pure read:
//  the run records it as `Reached`, the undo refuses there, and the durable
//  interpreter journals it. The demanded document's replay reasons and undo
//  posture now say so, read off the host's declared query posture
//  (`ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture`).
//
//  What is pinned here:
//    * for each evaluator posture — absent, a declared pure read, reaching —
//      the STATIC replay reasons and undo posture agree with what the RUN does:
//      a read the projection calls staged is exactly a read the durable
//      interpreter journals and replays from the journal, and an undo posture
//      one-way at a read is exactly a run whose undo is refused there;
//    * the agreement check can go red: the static postures read under a
//      declaration the registry does not make disagree with the run;
//    * absent and pure read publish the same document, carrying no reason for
//      the read, as every posture did before the token existed.

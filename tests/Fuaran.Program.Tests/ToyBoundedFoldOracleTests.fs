///
/// `proofs/BoundedFold.fst` is a model of the generic fold, and a model is a
/// claim about the code only if something runs the two side by side. This host
/// runs the EXTRACTION's generic `run_action` (`proofs/oracle/BoundedFold.fs`,
/// byte-identical to what the prover emitted) beside the core's own
/// `BoundedActions.run`, both at the toy witness (`ToyDomain.fs`, a domain with

///
/// It was first written (Phase 1896) inside the UI-typed parity suite, beside
/// the comparison at the UI witness. It is re-hosted here (fuaran#2017) because
/// nothing in it is UI-typed: the generic core is compared with the generic
/// model through a witness that is not the UI tier, in the project that reaches
/// no UI type — so the evidence does not leave the repository when the UI
/// adapters do.
///
/// The model's witness is DERIVED from the production one rather than written
/// beside it: its view is the production `View` applied to exhaustion, and its
/// `Lower` / `Describe` / `Resolve` / reserved predicate are the production
/// members over the model's association-list store. So the only thing that can
/// disagree is the fold.
///
/// Three corpora answer different questions. The hand-written corpus names
/// every view shape, every refusal the fold owns, every way a guard halts
/// (Phase 1967), every arm and halt of the two flow shapes (Phase 1976) and the
/// per-element iteration (Phase 1990). The answering arm crosses the placement
/// seam. The specification's toy driver-semantics family (fuaran#2011) is the

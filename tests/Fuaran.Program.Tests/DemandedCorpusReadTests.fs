/// this repository's own `Demanded.decode` over the vector's document, rendered
/// exactly as the emitter renders it, and compared byte for byte. A codec change
/// that moves any reading turns this red here, where the codec is, rather than

/// verbatim; the byte copy of this file that the emitter compares against is
/// what keeps the two renderings from drifting apart without a red somewhere.

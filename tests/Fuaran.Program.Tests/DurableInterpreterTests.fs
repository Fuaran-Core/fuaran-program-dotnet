/// The durable interpreter at the TOY witness — what Phase 2165 (D39) added to
/// it, pinned against production:
///
///   * **the plan's entry read** (F-ENTRY): a plan that reads the world through
///     the run's `EntryReader` is journaled at its ordinal under `ReadEntry`,
///     and a re-entry of the same invocation is SERVED what the dead run's
///     entry saw — so a run killed after the op that MOVED what it read, and
///     before the stage after it, resumes against the record, stages the same
///     calls, serves the op and performs only the rest. The first case is the
///     reproduction the phase asked for first: the same interruption under a
///     witness that reads LIVE re-plans against the moved world and is refused
///     by the domain before any stage, with the stage after the op never
///     reached — the finding as it was reported on 0.7.1. A resume whose plan
///     would read another subject at that ordinal, or reach a stage where the
///     record holds a read, is refused under `durable-entry-read-diverged`
///     naming the read, never as the domain's own "nothing matched".
///   * **the run's prefix at the performer and the contract** (F-RECEIPTS): the
///     pre-op state and the receipts of the earlier op stages, in perform
///     order — a served stage's recorded receipt among them on a resume.
///   * **an idempotency facet per effect kind** (F-FACET): the kinds an op's
///     reach names, met per op, so a crash inside a write closes its window by
///     re-invoking while one inside a push is refused, under one declaration.
///   * **contracts composed by Program** (F-CONTRACTS): a list, checked in
///     order, the first that rejects naming the refusal.

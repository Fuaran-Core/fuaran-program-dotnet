// ─── The program wire codec, certified at the toy witness (fuaran#2017) ──────
//
// `ProgramWire` and `HandlerWire` are GENERIC over a witness, and until this
// suite the only evidence that they certify against the conformance corpus was
// gathered at the UI tier's witness — which is to say, the evidence lived
// beside the one domain the codecs were first written for. The specification
// now carries its codec families at a second SUBJECT (§10.7): the same handler,
// server-effect, client-effect and outcome documents with the toy witness's
// vocabulary in their referenced positions. This suite runs the generic codecs
// at the toy witness against every vector the manifest assigns to that
// subject, and against the vocabulary-free documents a host of either subject
// certifies as they stand.
//
// The corpus is the oracle, not this suite. Every assertion is driven by
// `manifest.json` — which vectors exist, which subject each is at, which
// document each is, what a reject vector must be refused FOR, and what derived
// classification a handler vector carries. Nothing enumerates a fixture by
// hand, because a hand-kept list is exactly how a corpus and a host quietly
// stop describing the same thing.
//
// The same five properties the referenced subject's suite asserts:
//
//   1. every `round-trip` vector decodes and re-encodes BYTE-IDENTICALLY;
//   2. every `reject` vector is refused FOR THE CLASS the manifest names;
//   3. every derived value a vector declares — `replaySafety` (§7.4) and
//      `replayReasons` (§7.5) — is RECOMPUTED from the decoded document;
//   4. the number of vectors run equals the number the manifest enumerates
//      for THIS subject (§10.1 point 6, §10.7);
//   5. a mutated fixture turns the harness red.
//
// ── The witness ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ToyDomain.witness` is left exactly as it is: its `Encode` members are the
// shapes the core hashes, and other suites pin those digests. What the codecs
// need is a witness whose action, op and effect codecs are the toy's WIRE
// codec (`ToyWire`), so the variant is composed here, member by member, and
// every other member — the views, the store, the reserved namespace — is the
// toy's own. The replay classification therefore runs over the toy's real
// views, which is the whole of what a toy-subject certification shows.

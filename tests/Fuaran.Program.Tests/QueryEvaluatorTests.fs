module Fuaran.Program.Tests.QueryEvaluatorTests

// ============================================================================
//  The query evaluator seam (Phase 1905, DECISIONS.md D34), at the toy witness.
//
//  What is pinned here:
//    * the law family: the in-memory fold certifies trivially, a host
//      evaluator that pushes a filter down to its source certifies and answers
//      the fold's table, and one that answers differently is reported with the
//      fixture it disagreed on;
//    * the handler: an absent evaluator is the fold (the existing suites pin
//      that byte for byte); a declared pure read runs in the plan phase,
//      unstaged; an evaluator its host could not declare a pure read is STAGED
//      like a host call — never asked when the plan halts, asked once after it
//      completes, one-way for undo;
//    * the gate and the argument policy decide before any evaluator is asked;
//    * the schema check: a host answer the statically derived schema refutes
//      halts, naming both, whether the query was staged or not;
//    * the durable interpreter journals a staged query at its ordinal and a
//      replay serves it without asking the evaluator again;
//    * the facets read the declaration, and the check finds a staged
//      evaluator they were not told about.

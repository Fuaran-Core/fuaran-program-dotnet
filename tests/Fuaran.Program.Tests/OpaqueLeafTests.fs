module Fuaran.Program.Tests.OpaqueLeafTests

// ============================================================================
//  A leaf may declare itself OPAQUE (Phase 2130, DECISIONS.md D40), at the
//  toy witness.
//
//  What is pinned here:
//    * the declaration: `LeafDeclaration.none` declares nothing and is
//      analysable; `LeafDeclaration.opaque` names the act and its reason class;
//    * the projection: `ofAction` and `ofTree` carry every opaque leaf a tree
//      reaches — through a sequence, both arms of a selection, a repeat's body
//      and a literal `Each`'s lowered bodies — distinct and sorted, and a leaf
//      that declares nothing still reads as demanding nothing, so the two are
//      told apart;
//    * the document: version 8 carries `opaqueLeaves`, round-trips it, and
//      refuses a document without it rather than defaulting it;
//    * coverage: an opaque leaf is REFUSED unless the host accepted its reason
//      class, a refusal no effect policy lifts; accepting one class accepts
//      only that class;
//    * the signed envelope's drift names an opaque leaf the signed bytes did
//      not carry.

/// A FOURTH witness of the generic core, written for Phase 1992: a GRID — cells
/// keyed by permanent identities, ops that write a cell, and named regions that
/// grow by a row — instantiating the state axis only, the way the verb
/// (`VerbDomain.fs`) does. It exists to exercise per-element iteration (Phase
/// 1990, D29) against the loops a spreadsheet's automation actually writes
/// before a real spreadsheet domain depends on it: a column of fixed
/// identities, a two-variable grid as a nested `Each`, a copy-values loop that
/// reads one identity and writes another, `For i = a To b` over a range, and an
/// `If` inside the loop body — and, since Phase 2186, a computed write through
/// the value channel (`LetValue`, D42). No UI type anywhere, like the toy and
/// the verb.
///
/// Its composition is `ProgramWitness<Grid, CellOp, Unfilled, Unfilled>`: a
/// grid's automation is a handler over its cells, reached by no event and
/// walking no tree, so the walk and dispatch axes are unfilled BY COMPOSITION
/// (D20) rather than filled vacuously. Every one of the state axis's nine
/// members is meaningful here — `Diff` included, which the verb leaves empty —
/// and `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.12 records the census and the findings.

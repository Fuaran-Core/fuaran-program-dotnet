module Fuaran.Program.Tests.ToyStagingOracleTests

// ============================================================================
//  fuaran#2017 — the differential hosts for the proved staging (Phase 1717),
//  the proved undo (Phase 1977) and the proved effect gate (Phase 1759, with
//  the op contract of Phases 1981 and 1984), at the TOY witness.
//
//  The three models (`proofs/oracle/Staging.fs`, `Undo.fs`, `EffectGate.fs`)
//  are generic in the tree, the bindings, the values, the ops, the queries,
//  the actions, the client effects and the fold's diagnostics. Until this
//  file, the only host that ran them beside production instantiated them at
//  the UI tier's types — so the evidence that the extractions ARE the code
//  was evidence about one witness, and it lived in a test project that
//  reaches the UI tier. Here the same comparisons run at the toy witness
//  (`ToyDomain`: node `ToyNode`, action `ToyAction`, store `ToyStore`, op
//  `ToyOp`, effect `ToyEffect`), in a project that reaches no UI type at all.
//
//  The structure is the UI host's, case for case: a translation layer that
//  builds the model's witness and registry from PRODUCTION's members (the
//  assumed rung), so that the only thing that can disagree with production is
//  the extraction; a scripted performer that fails at every position of a
//  staged list; and the three checks — outcomes, the performers' logs, and
//  the handler's claim about what ran outside against the log — every one of
//  which a GO RED case below shows losing.
//
//  Where the UI corpus leans on something the shipped toy witness does not
//  have, it is COMPOSED here over the toy's own types, never added to the
//  toy: an apply that can refuse (the toy's relabel is total), an op-channel
//  guard, and an undo classing some ops compensable and one-way. Each
//  composition is named and explained where it is declared.

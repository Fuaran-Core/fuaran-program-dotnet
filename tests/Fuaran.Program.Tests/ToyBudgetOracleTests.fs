/// Phase 1716 — the proved budget as oracle, at the TOY witness.
///
/// `proofs/Budget.fst` is a model of the core's generic pricing functions,
/// `Budget.treeCost` (over the walk axis's `Cost` and child surface) and
/// `Budget.actionCascadeCost` (over the dispatch axis's action view). Until
/// fuaran#2017 those were compared with their extraction only at the UI
/// witness, which is leaving the repository; this host compares them at the
/// toy witness (`ToyDomain.fs`), in the project that reaches no UI type.
///
/// What is compared is an INTEGER, not a verdict. Above the ceiling `treeCost`
/// stops walking, so what it returns depends on which nodes it visited first —
/// the model has to keep production's explicit stack, in production's push
/// order, or the two agree only on the verdict and not on the number. So the
/// trees here are priced at every ceiling AROUND their own exact cost, where
/// the early stop lives, and include fans of UNEQUAL nodes, whose
/// above-the-ceiling answer differs with the visiting order.
///
/// The cascade cost is compared over EVERY action shape the core accepts
/// (fuaran#2018): the sequence, the assignment, the call, the guard and the
/// leaves, and the three flow shapes — `Choose`, `Repeat` and `Each` — each
/// with several trees, nested in one another, and at the saturation bound.
/// Until 2018 the model had no shape for the three and a FINDING case held
/// the gap open; the model now carries them and that case is a comparison.
///
/// Out of scope here: the G2 gate. The UI host also compares the model's
/// `step` with the UI transport loop's budget stage; there is no toy driver,
/// so there is no toy G2 stage to compare, and nothing here claims one.
///
/// And the go-red cases are what say the comparison can lose: a walk that
/// accumulates with .NET's ordinary wrapping `+`, which must come out on the
/// wrong side of the ceiling, and a cascade that prices a selection by its
/// CHEAPER arm, which the harness must report.

# Fuaran.Program — API stability

**Status:** pre-1.0. The version is single-sourced from `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props`, and
every package (`Fuaran.Program`, `.Bounded`, `.Runtime`, `.Server`) shares it: a minor bump on an
untouched package costs nothing, and a per-package line would have to be right four times. From 0.6.0
to 0.7.1 the two UI adapter packages, `.UI` and `.Server.UI`, shared it too; since fuaran#2012 they
release from the UI tier's repository (see the next section). This file records, per version slot,
what a consumer pays to adopt it and why.

## Versioning policy

- A change to a package's public contract — or to the contract it was BUILT against — ships on a
  version AHEAD of every tagged or publicly pinned one. A tagged slot is some consumer's contract
  and is never re-packed.
- An untagged, publicly unpinned `<Version>` is a **draft** slot: an additive change rides it; a
  change of a higher class advances it.
- A draft is not a release. Tagging `v<version>` is the release gesture — the publish workflow fires
  on the tag — and it is a separate, recorded act, never a side effect of a change landing.

This document starts at `0.6.0`. The slots before it are recorded where they were cut, in the
comments beside `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props`, and are not restated here.

## 0.13.0 — DRAFT, not yet released — argument policy gains a floor and an opt-in Required clause (Phase 2262)

**Class: breaking.** `v0.12.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it: two closed DUs gain cases and the
demanded document's version moves, so the work lands for the `0.13.0` slot, which the version ledger
opened (`Directory.Build.props`), and it is tagged only by the separate release act. The substrate does not move. `DECISIONS.md` D55 records the design, including why the clauses
are the policy's own rather than Core's `intRange` / `closed` decode shapes.

### What a consumer gains

- Two policy clauses on `ServerConstraintClause`: `AtLeast(argument, limit)` — every value under the
  argument must be a canonical integer no less than `limit`, on `AtMost`'s reading (a non-integer
  refused, an absent argument vacuously satisfied), refused `argument-not-allowed:<argument>`; and
  `Required(argument)` — the effect must name the argument, the one clause NOT vacuous over an absent
  argument, refused `argument-required:<argument>`. Declared with `constrain`, carried by
  `withConstraints`, decided by `ServerArgumentPolicy.check` in declaration order with the other
  stateless clauses.
- One defect on `ServerConstraintDefect`: `Missing argument`, rendered `argument-required:<argument>`.
- The demanded document's clause discriminators `atLeast` (`argument`, `limit`) and `required`
  (`argument`).

### What a consumer pays

- **Two closed DUs gain cases**: an exhaustive `match` over `ServerConstraintClause` (two new) or
  `ServerConstraintDefect` (one new) must take them.
- **The demanded document moves to version 14.** `Demanded.Version` and `decodableVersions` are `14`;
  a version-13 document is refused `UnknownVersion`, and an envelope signed under version 13 reports
  `Unreadable` drift until re-signed. A reader pinned to 13 refuses the two discriminators at the
  clause. A document for a host declaring neither clause differs from its version-13 bytes in the
  version alone.

### What did not move

Every existing clause's reading — `Required` is opt-in, and the vacuous reading of an absent argument
stands for every other clause — every denial and refusal token, every byte any encoder writes for a
host declaring neither clause (the demanded document's version excepted), the specification, and
every theorem in `proofs/EffectGate.fst`: the staging theorems quantify over an arbitrary argument
policy, and the two clauses are stateless.

## 0.12.0 — the program wire cites Core's JSON syntax and states its limits (Phase 2259), and what rode the draft (Phases 2213, 2260, 2436, 2261)

**Class: additive surface, narrowed decode.** `v0.11.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it: the work
lands for the `0.12.0` slot, which the version ledger opened,
released as `v0.12.0`. The substrate does not move: `Fuaran.Core.*` 0.40.2 already carries the strict grammar
(fuaran-core#462) and the limits record (fuaran-core#465). DECISIONS.md D50 records the design.

### What a consumer gains

- **`RefusalClass.MalformedJson`** (`malformed-json`) and **`RefusalClass.LimitExceeded`**
  (`limit-exceeded`), two new `Literal`s.
- **`WireLimits`**: the nine values as `Literal`s, `WireLimits.json` (the `JsonLimits` record
  `parseDocument` reads under) and `WireLimits.readOptions`.
- **`ProgramWire.checkActionShape`**, **`ProgramWire.limitRefusal`** and **`ProgramWire.withinStage`**.

### What a consumer pays

- **A parse refusal changes class.** `ProgramWire.parseDocument` — and so `HandlerWire.decodeHandler`
  and `decodeReport` — refuses text the cited grammar refuses as `malformed-json`; it was
  `malformed-referenced-value`. A repeated member was already refused (Core 0.38 onward); only its
  class moves. The depth cap's breach is now `limit-exceeded` at 256 (it was a malformed text at
  Core's own 512). A caller matching on the old class for a syntax failure must match the new one.
- **Documents past a limit no longer decode.** A document past §2.10's five bounds, and a handler or
  action past §2.11's four (action depth 32, 1 024 actions per handler, a repeat bound or parameter
  `hi` above 1 024, an `Each` over more than 1 024 elements or under a larger ceiling), is refused
  `limit-exceeded` at `parseDocument`, `decodeActionIn` / `decodeAction` and `decodeHandlerJson`. An
  action built in memory and never decoded is unaffected: the bounds are the WIRE's, and the fold
  and budget read what they always read.

### What did not move

- Every byte any encoder writes, every round-trip vector, and every refusal of a document that parses
  and sits within the limits.
- `null-member`, `undeclared-member` and `$type` dispatch, exactly as before.

### Rides the draft: the handler decoder refuses an empty `RunQuery` name and an empty `Notify` channel (Phase 2213)

**Class: additive surface, narrowed decode** — the draft's own class, so it rides rather than advances
it. No public type, member or signature moves. `DECISIONS.md` D51 records what was decided.

**What a consumer pays: documents that decoded before are refused.** `PROGRAM_WIRE.md` §5.1 says `fn`,
`name`, `channel`, `code` and `severity` MUST be non-empty, and the decoder held only `fn`, `code` and
`severity` to it. Now `HandlerWire.decodeEffect` — and so `decodeHandler` / `decodeHandlerJson` —
refuses a `RunQuery` whose `name` is `""` and a `Notify` whose `channel` is `""`, on `missing-member`,
as it already refused an empty `fn`. A caller that stored such a document can no longer read it back.
No conformant encoder writes one.

**And one detail string changes.** An empty `fn` is refused with `member 'fn' is empty` (it read
`the host function name is empty`), the sentence the other four members carry. The class is unchanged.

**What did not move:** every encoder. A typed `RunQuery("", …)` or `Notify("", …)` still encodes; the
document it encodes to is the one now refused, so such a value round-trips only when non-empty.

### Rides the draft: effects are limited over time windows by the host (Phase 2260)

**Class: breaking** — the draft's own class, so it rides rather than advances it. `DECISIONS.md` D52
records what was decided; `proofs/EffectGate.fst` models the decision and proves it.

**What a consumer gains.**

- Three policy clauses on `ServerConstraintClause`: `PerWindow(count, window)` — at most `count`
  admissions of the capability per `window`; `QuantityPerWindow(argument, quantity, window)` — at
  most `quantity` of the named argument's integer value summed over the admissions of a `window`;
  `Dwell(window)` — at least `window` between admissions. Windows and dwells are in the HOST clock's
  unit; every number is a 32-bit integer like the document's others. Declared with `constrain`,
  carried by `withConstraints`, decided by `ServerArgumentPolicy.check` after the stateless clauses.
- `DurableServices.Clock` and `DurableServices.withClock`: the host clock the limits are judged
  against, read once per invocation and journaled under `ReadClock` so a replay is served it.
- `ServerEffectRegistry.Limiter` / `withLimiter` and the `WindowedLimiter` type; `WindowedLimit`
  (with `WindowedLimit.ofClauses` / `none`), `WindowCounter` (`fresh`, `key`, `encode`, `decode`),
  `WindowDecision`, and `WindowedLimits.decide` — the pure decision the model proves.
- Four defects on `ServerConstraintDefect` — `OverWindow`, `OverQuantity`, `WithinDwell`,
  `Unjudgeable` — plus `Recorded`, the shape a refusal served from the journal arrives in; their
  tokens `admissions-over-window:<count>/<window>`, `quantity-over-window:<argument>:<quantity>/<window>`,
  `within-dwell:<window>` and `limit-unjudgeable:<reason>`.
- Two journal capabilities, `Durable.ClockCapability` (`ReadClock`) and `Durable.LimitCapability`
  (`Limit`): a host reads admissions and refusals off the effect journal.
- `ServerArgumentPolicy.integerOf` is `internal` rather than `private` (the counter codec reads it).

**What a consumer pays.**

- **Two records gain a field.** A full-literal construction of `ServerEffectRegistry` (now
  `Limiter`) or `DurableServices` (now `Clock`) fails with FS0764 until it names the member;
  `denyAll` and `DurableServices.create` carry the defaults. **Two closed DUs gain cases**: an
  exhaustive `match` over `ServerConstraintClause` (three new) or `ServerConstraintDefect` (five new)
  must take them.
- **The demanded document moves to version 12.** `Demanded.Version` and `decodableVersions` are
  `12`; a version-11 document is refused `UnknownVersion`, and an envelope signed under version 11
  reports `Unreadable` drift until re-signed. The three clause discriminators `perWindow`,
  `quantityPerWindow` and `dwell` join the closed set; a reader pinned to 11 refuses them at the
  clause. A document for a host declaring no windowed limit differs from its version-11 bytes in the
  version alone.
- **A windowed clause under a placement with no clock refuses the capability.** `denyAll`'s limiter
  and the direct interpreter judge no window: a host that declares one and supplies no
  `DurableServices.Clock` has declared a bound nobody can read, and it refuses
  `limit-unjudgeable:no-clock` rather than admitting. A host that declared nothing windowed pays
  nothing: the limiter is reached only when a windowed clause exists.
- **An invocation under a windowed limit journals more.** One `ReadClock` ordinal, then one `Limit`
  ordinal per decision, interleaved with the plan's other reads in plan order; a journal written
  before this release holds none and replays as before. The outcome's store gains the capability's
  counters under `<reserved prefix>limit/<capability>` — whether or not the handler committed.

**What did not move.** Every stateless clause, every denial, every byte any encoder writes for a host
declaring no windowed clause (the demanded document's version excepted), and every theorem in
`proofs/EffectGate.fst` above the new section: the staging theorems quantify over the policy arrow
the decision is composed into.

### Rides the draft: the invocation decoder refuses an empty endpoint and an empty nodeId (Phase 2436)

**Class: additive surface, narrowed decode** — the draft's own class, so it rides rather than advances
it. One public member is added and nothing moves. `DECISIONS.md` D53 records what was decided.

**What a consumer pays: documents that decoded before are refused.** `PROGRAM_WIRE.md` §8.3 says an
invocation's `endpoint` and `nodeId` are non-empty strings, and `ProgramWire.decodeInvocation` read both
with a bare string check. Now it refuses an invocation whose `endpoint` is `""` or whose `nodeId` is
`""`, on `missing-member`, with the detail `member '<name>' is empty` — the class and sentence the
handler decoder gives `fn`, `name` and `channel`. A caller that stored such an invocation can no longer
read it back. No conformant encoder writes one.

**What a consumer gains: `ProgramWire.requireNonEmpty`.** The check Phase 2213 wrote as a private helper
in `HandlerWire` now lives once in `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`, beside `requireString`, and both decoders
call it. `HandlerWire`'s refusals are byte-for-byte unchanged.

**What did not move:** every encoder. A typed `InvocationRecord` with an empty `Endpoint` or `NodeId`
still encodes; the document it encodes to is the one now refused, so such a record round-trips only
when both members are non-empty. The idempotency key's two refusals, and their order after these, are
unchanged.

### Rides the draft: a domain declares a quantity per leaf, and the budget prices its worst case before the program runs (Phase 2261)

**Class: breaking** — the draft's own class, so it rides rather than advances it. `DECISIONS.md` D54
records what was decided; `proofs/Budget.fst` extends the Phase 1716 theorem to the declared quantity.

**What a consumer gains.**

- `QuantityDeclaration` (`Name`, `Unit: Fuaran.Core.UnitOfMeasure`, `Amount`) and
  `LeafDeclaration.Quantities`: a witness declares, per leaf, the named quantities the leaf spends at
  worst, typed by the Core unit algebra.
- `Budget.quantityCost witness name unit action` — D35's rules without the step, saturating — and
  `Budget.declaredQuantities`.
- `QuantityDemand` and `DemandedProjection.Quantities`: the worst case per (name, unit), the dearest
  handler's over a tree and the sum over a union; `QuantityCeiling`, `HostCoverage.QuantityCeilings`
  and `HostCoverage.withQuantityCeilings`; `CoverageFinding.QuantityOverCeiling` and
  `CoverageFinding.QuantityUnitMismatch`, with their `describe` sentences.
- The pin `Fuaran.Core.Unit` 0.40.2, referenced by `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`.

**What a consumer pays.**

- **Three records gain a field.** A full-literal construction of `LeafDeclaration` (now `Quantities`),
  `DemandedProjection` (now `Quantities`) or `HostCoverage` (now `QuantityCeilings`) fails with FS0764
  until it names the member; `LeafDeclaration.none`, `Demanded.empty` and `HostCoverage.nothing` carry
  the defaults, and every construction in this repository already builds from them. **One closed DU
  gains cases**: an exhaustive `match` over `CoverageFinding` must take the two.
- **The demanded document moves to version 13.** `Demanded.Version` and `decodableVersions` are `13`;
  a version-12 document is refused `UnknownVersion`, and an envelope signed under version 12 reports
  `Unreadable` drift until re-signed. The root gains `quantities`, present on every document (`[]`
  where the leaves declare none) and REQUIRED on read: a document without it is `MissingMember`, so a
  producer predating the member is told so rather than read as one that priced nothing. A document for
  a program declaring no quantity differs from its version-12 bytes in the version and the empty member.
- **A new transitive dependency.** `Fuaran.Program.Bounded` now references `Fuaran.Core.Unit`; a
  consumer restoring from nuget.org gains one package, Fable-clean and FSharp.Core-only.
- **A witness that declares a quantity is priced.** Nothing changes for a witness declaring none: its
  documents carry `[]` and no ceiling can ever refuse it.

**What did not move.** `Budget.actionCascadeCost`, `Budget.treeCost` and every cascade theorem (the
model's leaf gained an amount the cascade never reads); every byte of the handler and program wire;
every other member of the demanded document; `ServerSession.initStrict`'s shape — it already
consulted `checkProjection` before building a session, which is where the new finding is answered.

## 0.11.0 — the substrate raise to Fuaran.Core 0.40.2 (Phase 2228)

**Class: breaking**, by this file's first rule: the contract every package is BUILT against moved.
The substrate is `Fuaran.Core.*` 0.40.2 (was 0.38.1) and `Fuaran.Compute.DataFrame` 0.41.0 (was
0.40.0). `0.10.2` is published, so this cannot ride it: it opened the `0.11.0` slot, released as `v0.11.0`. The surface
guard, run over the packed `0.10.2` packages from nuget.org and this tree's packs, reports every
package's own surface unchanged; the class is the substrate's, exactly as at `0.10.0`.

### What changed shape

- **Nothing in this repository's own public surface.** Every type and member signature is as it was
  at 0.10.2.
- **What a consumer meets is Core's 0.39.0 and 0.40.0 releases, through this one.** Every canonical
  byte rule is a named `Rendering`, written through `Canonical.write` (`Canon` is gone: Core D188),
  and every JSON read goes through `Json.read` under a `ReadOptions` (`Json.parseDetailed` and the
  tolerant parses are gone; the depth cap is a limit breach rather than a malformed text). Core's
  `docs/releases/0.39.0.md` and `0.40.0.md` are the edit list.
- **Why it cannot stay at 0.10.2 for a consumer on the newer substrate:** 0.10.2's packages were
  compiled against Core 0.38.1 and call `Canon.render`, `Canon.typed` and `Json.parseDetailed`. A
  graph that resolves Core 0.39.0 or later restores 0.10.2 cleanly and then fails with
  `MissingMethodException` on any path that renders or parses a program document.

### What did not move

- **The program wire, byte for byte.** Each of the five renderers (`ProgramWire`, `BoundedActions`'
  reversal encoding, `EffectRegistry`'s denial, `HandlerWire` and the `Journal`'s control entries)
  writes under `Rendering.CrossHost`, which is the old `Canon.render` (Core's `EncodingProfileVectors`
  holds a column per rendering), and every scenario of the conformance corpus certifies unchanged.
- **Every refusal a document parse returns.** The depth cap's breach is lifted back to the classified
  error the parser gave before, with the same sentence and position, so a `WireRefusal` and a
  `DemandedDecodeFailure` read exactly as they did.
- The journal entries an existing run writes, every refusal class and every halt reason.

## 0.10.2 — a derived view computed once per input (Phase 2220); the relation primitives removed before release (Phase 2382)

**0.10.1 was never released.** It was a draft slot that was packed to a local feed while it still carried
`Fuaran.Program.Relation`, and one local consumer built against that pack. Its contents then changed, so the
release names the next patch instead. A released version names one contract. Nothing published carries 0.10.1.

**Class: additive** relative to `v0.10.0`, the last release. `v0.10.0` is TAGGED, so this advanced `<Version>`
rather than riding it. Every member below is new. No existing type gains a field or a case, and no existing function's
signature moves. The one signature that did change, `Durable.runGuarded`'s witness builder, is
`internal`. DECISIONS.md D47 records the design, and D49 the removal below.

### What was added

- **`Fuaran.Program.Server`**: `Derivation` (and its module), `DerivationRecorder` (`live`,
  `Capability = "Derive"`), `DerivedView<'T, 'V>` (`DerivedView.ofContent`), the per-run ledger
  `Derivations` (`Over`, `Of`, `OfRead`, `Derived`, `Computations`), and `Durable.runDeriving`,
  `Durable.derivations` and `Durable.DeriveCapability`.

### What was removed before release

- **`Fuaran.Program.Relation`** (Phase 2220 added it to this draft; Phase 2382 deleted it, D49). The
  graph questions have one home, `Fuaran.Core.Relation` (Core D205), which ported its law set. The
  module was never released, so its removal is no change relative to `v0.10.0`, and this draft stays
  additive. The `Fuaran.Program` package's surface is again exactly its `0.10.0` surface. A caller
  that compiled against the unreleased draft moves to `Fuaran.Core.Relation`: `Relation.ofMap` over
  the same map, then the same question; component members come in the pass's order, not ascending.

### What a consumer pays

Nothing. Adopting the derived view means building the witness through `Durable.runDeriving` in place
of `runReading`. A run that derives nothing journals nothing new.

### What did not move

- The program wire and the conformance corpus. Neither construct crosses the wire (D47).
- The journal entries an existing run writes. `Derive` appears only where a witness derives a view.

## 0.10.0 — RELEASED (tagged `v0.10.0`, 2026-10-17) — the substrate raise to Fuaran.Core 0.38.1

**Class: breaking**, by this file's first rule: the contract every package is BUILT against moved.
The substrate is `Fuaran.Core.*` 0.38.1 (was 0.34.0) and `Fuaran.Compute.DataFrame` 0.40.0 (was
0.37.0). `v0.9.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it: it opens the `0.10.0` draft.

### What changed shape

- **Nothing in this repository's own public surface.** Every type and member signature is as it was
  at 0.9.0.
- **What a consumer meets is Core's 0.37.0 release, through this one.** A `Schema` is a `Field list`
  (`f.Name`, `f.Type`) rather than `(name, type)` pairs, a `Column` holds typed vectors (`Column.ofInts`,
  `Column.ofCells`, `Column.length`; `Cells` is gone), and a `Column`, `Table` or `DataSource` is equal
  but no longer comparable. Core's `docs/migrations/0.37.0-typed-column.md` is the edit list.
- **Why it cannot stay at 0.9.0 for a consumer on the newer substrate:** 0.9.0's `Server` package was
  compiled against Core 0.34.0 and calls `DataSource.CompareTo` and `Table.CompareTo`, and the
  evaluator it pulls in (`Fuaran.Compute.DataFrame` 0.37.0) calls `Column.Cells` and the nullary
  `TimestampType`. A graph that resolves Core 0.37.0 or later restores 0.9.0 cleanly and then fails
  with `MissingMethodException` on any path that reaches them.

### What was added

- `QueryFault.evalErrorKind` names the evaluator's new `UnitMismatch` refusal (a unit conversion
  across dimensions, `Fuaran.Compute.DataFrame` 0.40.0) as `"UnitMismatch"`.
- `Schema.readsOfExpr` reads through the evaluator's new `ColExpr.Convert` (its target unit reads no
  column).

### What did not move

- The program wire, the conformance corpus, every refusal class and every halt reason the 0.9.0
  evaluator could produce.

## 0.9.0 — RELEASED (tagged `v0.9.0`, 2026-10-10) — the value channel on the state axis (Phase 2186), and what rode the draft (Phases 2197, 2187, 2195)

**Class: breaking**, by this file's own rule, for every consumer that matches an `OpView<'Node, 'Op>`
exhaustively, constructs a `DemandedProjection` as a full record literal, reads a demanded document
with a pinned reader, or constructs the extracted staging model's `witness` as a full literal.
Additive for everyone else. `v0.8.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it: it opens the `0.9.0` draft.
`DECISIONS.md` D42 records what was decided; this entry records what a consumer pays.

### What changed shape

- **`OpView<'Node, 'Op>` gains `Let of placeholder: string * value: StateValue<'Node> * body: 'Op
  list`** — the value channel on the state axis. A domain whose `View` never answers it is
  unaffected; a consumer that matches the view exhaustively (a performer, a walk of its own) adds the
  arm. `StateValue<'Node>` is `{ Name: string; Resolve: 'Node -> ExprResolution }`, equal by name on
  `StateCollection`'s terms.
- **`DemandedProjection` gains `Values: ValueDemand list`** (`{ Value: string; Targets: string list
  }`), distinct and sorted like every other list; `Demanded.empty` carries `[]`, and a full literal
  adds it. The signed envelope's drift report compares it.
- **The demanded document is at version 9**: the root gains `values` (an array of `{"value",
  "targets"}` objects, after `opaqueLeaves`, before `server`), `Demanded.Version` is `9` and
  `decodableVersions` is `[9]`. A reader pinned to version 8 refuses a version-9 document, as the
  document's rule says it must; `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json` is re-cut at version 9,
  and the UI tier's emitter re-emits it when that tier adopts this release.
- **The extracted staging model's `witness` gains `w_resolve: string -> t -> resolution v`** and its
  `op_view` the arm `OLetOf name value body`; `Staging.resolution` is new. A differential host that
  builds the model witness as a full literal adds the member.

### What was added

- `OpView.values` and `StateWitness.values` (the value demands of an op sequence);
  `ExprWitness.valueName` and `ExprWitness.value` (a `StateValue` over a domain's expression witness
  instantiated at its state — the one new arrow, a constructor); `ValueDemand`.
- `OpView.beneath`, `OpView.scopeDefects` and `OpView.iterations` read through the new arm;
  `ProgramWire.replayDefectsOfOp` reports `non-literal-write` for it; `Undo.defectsOfOps` reads its
  body once with the placeholder standing; `Handler.planOps` resolves the value through the
  placement's `ExtentReader` (a one-element extent under the value's name — journaled under
  `ReadExtent`, served on replay) and plans the substituted body.
- `proofs/Staging.fst`: `let_of_plans_as_body_when_resolved`, `let_of_unresolved_plans_nothing`,
  `let_of_errored_plans_nothing`, `plan_view_let_of`, `trail_view_let_of`; `Undo.fst` and
  `EffectGate.fst` take the arm; `proofs.json` gains four rows.

### What did not move

- **Every handler that carries no `Let` plans, journals, classifies and projects byte-identically**,
  except that its demanded document now carries `"values":[]` at version 9. The program wire
  specification and its corpus do not change, and no wire codec was touched (D42, "Why the wire does
  not move").
- **`ExprResolution` and its three outcomes** are what the channel resolves to; no new resolution
  type on the .NET side.
- **The `ExtentReader` seam and the `ReadExtent` journal capability** carry the value's resolution;
  no new reader seam and no new capability, so a journal written before this release replays
  unchanged.

### Rides the draft: a performed write's receipt is its return value, typed (Phase 2197)

**Class: breaking.** `v0.8.0` is TAGGED, so this ADVANCES `<Version>` to `0.9.0` rather than riding
it; a later breaking or additive change rides this draft until it is tagged. A DU case's payload, a
record field's type and two records' members change, and every consumer that registers an op
performer, declares an op contract or constructs a `HandlerOutcome` or `HandlerTally` literal meets
it at compile time. `DECISIONS.md` D43 records what was decided; this entry records what a consumer
pays.

### What changed shape

- **An op performer RETURNS `OpReceipt`, not `JVal`.** `OpPerformance.Performed` carries
  `OpPrefix<'Node> -> 'Node -> 'Op -> Result<OpReceipt, string>`. `OpReceipt` is `{ Writes:
  WriteReceipt list; Detail: JVal }`: the writes performed, each `{ Target: string; Digest:
  ContentDigest }`, and the 0.8.0 receipt kept verbatim as the detail.
- **`OpPerformance.performedBy` takes a performer answering `OpReceipt`.** A 0.8.0 performer that
  answers a `JVal` moves to the new `performedWithDetail`, unchanged in body, and its receipt names no
  write. `performedWithPrefix` and `performedChecked` take `OpReceipt`-answering performers; a 0.8.0
  body maps its answer through `OpReceipt.ofDetail`. `performedWithoutReceipt` keeps its signature
  and answers `OpReceipt.none`.
- **`OpPrefix.Receipts` is `OpReceipt list`** (it was `JVal list`): 2165's untyped prefix is TYPED,
  not replaced. A performer that read a prior receipt's JVal reads its `.Detail`.
- **`OpContract.Holds` and `OpContract.at` take the `OpReceipt`.** A 0.8.0 contract over the JVal
  reads `receipt.Detail`.
- **`HandlerOutcome` and `HandlerTally` gain `Receipts: OpReceipt list`** (FS0764 on a full
  literal): the receipts the op stages answered, in perform order, and on an uncommitted outcome those
  of the stages that performed before the failure.
- **The durable journal records an op stage's completed value as `OpReceipt.encode`**:
  `{"writes":[{"target":…,"digest":…}],"detail":…}`. A journal written by 0.8.0 holds the bare
  receipt there and is REFUSED on resume as `op-receipt-malformed` — a run in flight across the
  upgrade is resumed under the version that started it, or abandoned. No wire byte and no
  specification document moves: the journal is a host's store, not the program wire.

### What was added

- `ContentDigest` (`ofBytes`, `ofText`, `parse`, `.Text`; private representation, SHA-256 over the
  exact bytes, `sha256:` + 64 lowercase hex), `WriteReceipt` (`ofBytes`, `ofText`), `OpReceipt`
  (`none`, `ofDetail`, `ofWrites`, `encode`, `decode`, `MalformedCode`).
- The union: `Receipts.writes`, `final`, `changed`, `account`, `accountAll`;
  `HandlerOutcome.changed` and `HandlerOutcome.account`; the refusal shape `ForeignWrite`,
  `ForeignCause` (`Unreceipted`, `DigestDiffers`), `ForeignWrite.describe`, `refusal` and `Code`
  (`foreign-write`).

### What did not move

- An in-memory placement is unchanged: it stages no op, so its outcome's `Receipts` is empty.
- The prefix's order, the contract composition and the perform fold are 2165's, unchanged; only the
  receipt's type moved.

### Rides the draft: the static postures name a staged query evaluator (Phase 2187)

**Class: breaking**, and it rides the untagged `0.9.0` draft, which D42 opened at that class. Two
closed DUs gain a case, which breaks every exhaustive match over them. Fifteen functions gain a
leading parameter, and every caller meets it at compile time. A pinned reader of the demanded
document refuses version 10. `DECISIONS.md` D44 records what was decided; this entry records what a
consumer pays.

### What changed shape

- **`ReplayDefect` gains `StagedQuery`** (wire token `staged-query`, grade `unsafe`), and **`UndoDefect`
  gains `StagedQuery`** (token `staged-query`, grade `one-way`). A consumer matching either
  exhaustively adds the arm.
- **Every posture derivation takes the host's `QueryPosture` as its first parameter:**
  `HandlerWire.replayReasons` and `replaySafety`; `Replay.admit`, `admitAll`, `postureOf`,
  `withPostures` and `ofTreeAndHandlers`; `Undo.defectsOfStage`, `reasons`, `posture`, `postureOf`,
  `withPostures` and `ofTreeAndHandlers`; `Harvest.ofProgram` and `ofRegistration`. A host passes
  `ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture registry`. A caller with no registry in hand, and no evaluator,
  passes `QueryPosture.PureRead` and gets exactly the 0.8.0 answer.
- **`Replay.admit` refuses to resume a handler holding a read under a `Reaching` posture** under
  `Replay.strict`, as it refuses one holding a host call. Its derived safety is `unsafe`.
- **The demanded document is at version 10.** No member moves. `staged-query` may appear as a `defect`
  in both `server.replay[].reasons` and `server.undo[].reasons`. `Demanded.Version` is `10`,
  `decodableVersions` is `[10]`, and `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json` is re-cut at
  version 10.
- **The program wire specification is at format version 3.** §7.5's vocabulary gains `staged-query`,
  §7.4 gains the host query posture, and a handler vector may carry `queryEvaluator`. No document's
  bytes move. A host certifying the referenced subject's handler vectors recomputes under the vector's
  `queryEvaluator`.

### What was added

- `QueryEvaluator.postureOf` (`None` is the in-memory fold, `PureRead`) and
  `ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture`: the one place the host's declaration enters the static
  projection.

### What did not move

- **A host with no evaluator, or a pure-read one, publishes the same postures as 0.8.0**: a read
  contributes no reason. Its demanded document differs in the version alone.
- **The runtime**: staging, journaling and the undo's refusal at a `Reached` step are D34's,
  unchanged. This entry only makes the projection say them.
- **The extracted model and the oracle differential**, which run at `PureRead`.

### Rides the draft: a program reports a finding into its trace (Phase 2195)

**Class: breaking**, and it rides the untagged `0.9.0` draft, which D42 opened at that class. A closed
DU gains a case, which breaks every exhaustive match over it, and three records gain a field, which
breaks every full-literal construction of them. A pinned reader of the demanded document refuses
version 11. `DECISIONS.md` D45 records what was decided; this entry records what a consumer pays.

### What changed shape

- **`ServerEffect` gains `Report of Finding`** (wire `$type` `Report`; capability `Report`). A
  consumer matching `ServerEffect` exhaustively adds the arm. `ServerEffect.kinds` names six arms.
- **`HandlerOutcome` gains `Findings: Finding list`** (in program order; kept on an uncommitted
  outcome, as `Diagnostics` and `Flow` are), and **`HandlerTally` gains `Findings`**. A consumer that
  builds either as a full record literal adds the field; `[]` is the 0.8.0 meaning.
- **`ServerEffectRegistry` gains `RecordFinding: FindingRecorder`**, set to `FindingRecorder.live`
  by `denyAll`. A consumer building the registry from `denyAll` and the `with`/combinator forms pays
  nothing; one building it as a full literal adds the field.
- **The demanded document is at version 11.** No member moves. `Report` may appear in
  `server.effects` and `server.capabilities`, and a finding's `code` and `severity` appear in
  `server.reach` under the `Report` capability. `Demanded.Version` is `11`, `decodableVersions` is
  `[11]`, and `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json` is re-cut at version 11.
- **The program wire specification widens §5.1 at format version 3**, beside `staged-query`: a
  sixth server-effect arm, `Report` (`code`, `message`, `severity`; `code` and `severity` non-empty,
  refused `missing-member` when empty). A version-2 reader refuses a `Report` document as
  `unknown-effect-arm`. No existing document's bytes move.
- **Removed: `ServerEffectRegistry.withExtentReader`.** Nothing in this repository or its known
  consumers called it, and its own comment said a host had no reason to; the durable interpreter sets
  the member directly. A consumer that called it writes `{ registry with ReadExtent = reader }`.

### What was added

- `Finding` — `{ Code; Severity; Message }`, the host's tokens, carried and never interpreted — with
  `Finding.encode`, `decode`, `subject` and the member names; `FindingRecorder` and
  `FindingRecorder.live`.
- `Durable.findings journal invocation`: an invocation's findings read off its journal alone, in
  program order. `Durable.FindingCapability` names the capability they are journaled under.
- A host declares its finding vocabulary as an allow-list on the `Report` capability's `code` and
  `severity` arguments (`ServerEffectRegistry.constrain "Report" …`); nothing new is needed for it.

### What did not move

- **A handler that reports nothing** runs, journals, derives its postures and publishes its demanded
  document exactly as before, the version number aside.
- **The outcome document** (`HandlerReport`) carries no finding: `Findings` is host-side, as `Flow`
  and `Receipts` are. A reached report appears in `Performed` as `Report`.
- **The replay and undo vocabularies**: a report contributes no reason to either.
- **The extracted staging model and the oracle differential**, which have no report arm (D45).

## 0.8.0 — RELEASED (tagged `v0.8.0`, 2026-10-09) — the query evaluator seam on `RunQuery` (Phase 1905), and what rode the draft (Phases 1991, 1993, 2018, 2019, 2130, 2165, 2175)

**Class: breaking**, by this file's own rule, for a consumer that constructs a
`ServerEffectRegistry` or a `PerformerFacets` as a full record literal (FS0764 names the missing
member). Additive for everyone else. `v0.7.1` is tagged, so this cannot ride it. `DECISIONS.md` D34
records what was decided; this entry records what a consumer pays.

### What changed shape

- **`ServerEffectRegistry` gains `QueryEvaluator: QueryEvaluator option`.** `None` is the in-memory
  fold, exactly as before, and it is what `ServerEffectRegistry.denyAll` carries. A registry built
  from `denyAll` and the `with`-style functions needs nothing. A full literal adds
  `QueryEvaluator = None`.
- **`PerformerFacets` gains `QueryEvaluator: IdempotencyFacet option`**, which declares what
  repeating a staged query evaluator does. `PerformerFacets.none` carries `None`, and a full literal
  adds `QueryEvaluator = None`. With `None`, the facets derive `RunQuery` exactly as before.

### What was added

- **The seam:** `QueryEvaluator` (the source, the pipeline and the named-source resolver, answered as
  a table), `QueryFault`, `QueryPosture`, and the `QueryEvaluator` module: `inMemory` (the fold, the
  reference), `reaching`, `pureRead`, `checkedAgainst` and `through`.
  `ServerEffectRegistry.withQueryEvaluator`, `ServerEffectRegistry.checkingQueries`,
  `ServerServices.withQueryEvaluator`, `ServerServices.effects`.
- **The law family:** `QueryFixture`, `QueryLawFinding`, `QueryEvaluatorLaws.certify`. A host runs
  these to hold its evaluator to the fold.
- **The durable and facet half:** `DurableServices.declaringQueryEvaluator`,
  `PerformerFacets.declareQueryEvaluator`, `isQueryEvaluatorDeclared`, `queryEvaluatorFacet`,
  `Facets.undeclaredQueryEvaluator`, and `Durable.QueryStageCapability`.

### What did not move

- **With no evaluator registered, behaviour is byte-identical**: the same fold, the same halt
  reasons, the same `Performed` order. The program wire specification and its corpus do not change,
  and no codec was touched.
- **What a host pays only if it opts in.** Under a staged evaluator, `RunQuery` is performed after the
  plan, like a `HostCall`. Its table lands then, so a `Compute` stage after it in the same handler
  does not see it; the existing `HostCall`-with-`into` arm already behaves this way. It is journaled at
  its own ordinal, and it is one-way for undo. A declared pure read keeps today's placement.
- **What the server placement now checks, only for a registered evaluator:** the answer's schema
  against the statically derived one. That check runs through `ServerServices.effects`, which is the
  registry every interpreter behind the placement's call actions now takes.

### Rides the draft: `Each` over a collection the store holds (Phase 1991)

**Class: breaking**, for every consumer that constructs or matches an `ActionView.Each` or an
`OpView.Each`, annotates an `OpView<'Op>`, constructs a `HandlerArm`, a `ServerEffectRegistry` or a
`DemandedProjection` as a full record literal, matches `Trace` exhaustively, or reads a demanded
document — the class this slot already carries (D34), so it rides rather than advancing. `v0.7.1` is
the newest tag and nothing public pins `0.8.0`. D29 foreclosed a collection the store holds; the
operator's ruling of 2026-10-02 admitted it under four conditions; `DECISIONS.md` D36 records what
was decided; this entry records what a consumer pays.

- **`ActionView.Each`'s collection is a `Collection<'Expr>`** — `Literal of elements: JVal list`
  (what the list was) or `Stored of source: 'Expr * ceiling: int`, an expression resolved against
  the binding store ONCE at entry, refused before the first element when its extent is over the
  ceiling. **`OpView<'Op>` becomes `OpView<'Node, 'Op>`**, and its `Each`'s collection is a
  `Collection<StateCollection<'Node>>`: `{ Name; Read: 'Node -> JVal list }`, the domain's own
  enumeration of the planned state, equal by name. Every match over either `Each` splits in two;
  every `OpView<X>` annotation gains the node type; `OpView.edits` still fills `View` unchanged.
- **`Trace` gains `EachOf of extent: JVal list * elements: Trace list`** — the extent the run READ,
  which `BoundedActions.reverse` lowers the body over; `FlowDecision.ofTrace` reads it as `Iterated`.
  A stored `Each` is IN the reversible fragment (the count is recorded, not re-read), where a
  parameter-bound `Repeat` is not.
- **`HandlerArm` gains `ReadExtent: ExtentReader`** (`HandlerArm.inert` reads live) and
  **`ServerEffectRegistry` gains `ReadExtent: ExtentReader`** (`denyAll` reads live;
  `withExtentReader`) — FS0764 on a full literal. `ExtentReader` is
  `string -> (unit -> Result<JVal list, string>) -> Result<JVal list, string>`: the subject and the
  live read. `Durable.runWith` journals the read at its ordinal under `ReadExtent`
  (`ExtentReader.Capability`), subject the collection's name (the binding keys the source reads, on
  the dispatch axis), the extent as the step's completed value, and SERVES it on replay. A journal
  with no such step replays exactly as before.
- **`DemandedProjection` gains `Iterations: IterationDemand list`** (`{ Collection; Ceiling }`), and
  the document gains `iterations` between `opaqueHandlers` and `server` and moves to **version 7**;
  `decodableVersions` is `[7]`. A program with no stored collection emits `"iterations":[]` and
  nothing else in its document moves — but its bytes do, so a signed envelope over a version-6
  document no longer verifies against a version-7 recomputation and is re-signed. This repository's
  `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json` moved to version 7 by hand, to exactly the encoder's
  bytes; the UI tier's generator re-emits it at its raise.
- **The budget prices a stored `Each` at its ceiling without the store** — one step for the read
  plus the body at the ceiling, the parameter-bound repeat's rule — so the driver's gate refuses an
  over-size loop before its first element. **The argument policy sees the body's reach with the
  placeholder standing** (the addresses are not in the tree); an allow-list that binds addresses
  refuses a stored loop whose addresses it cannot see. **The replay classification** reads a stored
  `Each` as a parameter bound: undecidable, beside the body's defects.
- **Four new refusals, each before the first element**: `the collection's ceiling is negative`,
  `the collection's extent is over its declared ceiling`, and on the dispatch axis `the collection
  did not resolve to a list` / `… to a value`; on the op axis the plan's `Failed` carries the same
  two ceiling reasons and whatever the reader answered.
- **Public walks:** `OpView.iterations` / `StateWitness.iterations` (the iteration demands of an op
  sequence), `ExprWitness.collectionName` (the dispatch-axis collection's name, the journal's
  subject and the document's spelling in one).
- **The oracle differentials** map the shape to the model's `VEachOf` / `OEachOf` (the extent the
  start store answers, the body lowered over it through production's `Substitute`) and the budget
  oracle to the parameter-bound repeat at the ceiling; the toy corpus gains the stored cases.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, fixture byte, refusal class or rule of the program wire
specification (D36 item 6: the collection source travels in the domain's codec; the demanded
document is deliberately ungoverned by the specification; the journal step is D23's
not-a-specification-act); no behaviour of any program that uses no stored collection, byte for byte
through the parity suite and the Fable leg, except the demanded document's version; the UI tier
views nothing as an `Each` and fills `ReadExtent` nowhere. Every earlier proof statement keeps its
form; the stored shape takes the literal's case in each once the extent is read.

**What a consumer does about it:** `docs/migrations/phase-1991.md` — one page, a diff per file.

### Rides the draft: a revoked op performer reads as absent in coverage (Phase 1993)

**Class: breaking**, which is the class the draft already carries, so it rides `0.8.0` rather than
advancing it (no `v0.8*` tag exists). `DECISIONS.md` D37 records what was decided, amending D28
item 2.

- **`ServerCoverage` gains `Withdrawn: Set<string>`** — the gate-facing capabilities whose performer
  the host has withdrawn. `ServerCoverage.nothing` carries the empty set, which means exactly what
  coverage meant before the member existed. A coverage built from `nothing` and the `with`-style
  functions needs nothing; a full record literal adds `Withdrawn = Set.empty` (FS0764 names it).
  Added: `ServerCoverage.withWithdrawn`.
- **`CoverageFinding` gains `ServerCapabilityWithdrawn of capability`**, declared between
  `UnregisteredServerFunction` and `ServerGateRefusesCapability`. An exhaustive `match` over
  `CoverageFinding` gains an arm; `Demanded.describe` reads it as "a handler this program can reach
  needs server capability '…', whose performer this host has withdrawn".
- **A behaviour a host can observe:** under `OpPerformance.Performed`, once the op performer is
  revoked, `Controls.coverage` / `DurableControls.coverage` carry `ApplyOps` in `Withdrawn` and leave
  the gate the registry's, so the demanded-effect check reports
  `CoverageFinding.ServerCapabilityWithdrawn "ApplyOps"` where 0.7.1's D28 reported
  `ServerGateRefusesCapability "ApplyOps"`, and `coverage.Gate "ApplyOps"` answers what the
  registry's gate answers instead of `false`. A withdrawn capability is reported before the gate is
  asked, so a session both suspended and revoked reports the op arm as withdrawn.

**What did not move:** a suspended session still reads as `ServerGateRefusesCapability`; a revoked
host performer still reads as `UnregisteredServerFunction`; with nothing revoked, and under
`OpPerformance.InMemory`, coverage and findings are what they were. Every signature, the control
stream and its monotonicity, the wire, every fixture and demanded-document byte, and every proof
statement are unchanged.

**What a consumer does about it:** add `Withdrawn = Set.empty` to a full `ServerCoverage` literal; add
an arm for `ServerCapabilityWithdrawn` to an exhaustive match over `CoverageFinding`; and a consumer
that branched on the op performer's withdrawal as `ServerGateRefusesCapability "ApplyOps"`, or read
`coverage.Gate "ApplyOps"` to detect it, reads `ServerCapabilityWithdrawn "ApplyOps"` /
`coverage.Withdrawn` instead.

### Rides the draft: the durable tier journals the plan's entry read; the op performer and its contracts see the run's prefix; a facet per effect kind; contracts compose (Phase 2165)

**Class: breaking**, which is the class the draft already carries, so it rides `0.8.0` rather than
advancing it (no `v0.8*` tag exists). The surface guard would class this breaking on its own: a DU
case changes its payload type and a record field its type, which every consumer that constructs or
reads them meets at compile time. `DECISIONS.md` D39 records what was decided; this entry records
what a consumer pays.

#### What changed shape

- **`OpPerformance.Performed` carries `OpPrefix<'Node> -> 'Node -> 'Op -> Result<JVal, string>`** —
  the run's PREFIX is handed first (F-RECEIPTS). `OpPrefix<'Node>` is new: `Before`, the planned
  state the op was applied to, and `Receipts`, the receipts of the op stages performed before it in
  the run, in perform order — under the durable interpreter a served stage's recorded receipt among
  them. `OpPerformance.performedBy` keeps its signature and lifts a prefix-blind performer;
  `performedWithoutReceipt` likewise; `performedWithPrefix` is the new form that reads it. A consumer
  that constructs `Performed` directly, or pattern-matches it to call the closure, adds the argument.
- **`OpContract.Holds` is `OpPrefix<'Node> -> 'Node -> 'Op -> JVal -> bool`**, so a contract can
  state what an op owed. `OpContract.at name holds` builds a contract over the planned state, the op
  and the receipt alone — the shape every contract had. `OpContract.check` takes and returns a
  prefix-aware performer.
- **`OpPerformance.performedChecked` takes a LIST of contracts** (F-CONTRACTS), composed by Program
  through the new `OpContract.checkAll`: checked in declaration order, the first that rejects names
  the refusal, the empty list being the performer unchecked. A consumer that passed one contract
  wraps it in a list; one that nested `OpContract.check` by hand lists them instead, first declared
  first.
- **`PerformerFacets` gains `OpKinds: Map<string, IdempotencyFacet>`** (F-FACET). `PerformerFacets.none`
  carries the empty map; a full record literal adds `OpKinds = Map.empty` (FS0764 names it).
  `PerformerFacets.isOpPerformerDeclared` is also true when any kind is declared, and
  `PerformerFacets.opPerformerFacet` — the ARM's static reading — is the meet over every kind
  declared and the whole-performer declaration where one was made, so a host that declares a
  non-idempotent kind reads the arm as non-idempotent for the derivation whatever the other kinds
  say.

#### What was added

- **The entry read (F-ENTRY):** `EntryReader` (`string -> (unit -> Result<JVal, string>) -> Result<JVal, string>`,
  the shape of `ExtentReader`), `EntryReader.live`, `EntryReader.Capability` = `"ReadEntry"`,
  `Durable.EntryReadCapability`, and **`Durable.runReading`** — `runWith` whose witness argument is a
  function of this run's `EntryReader`. A state witness whose `Apply` reads the world builds itself
  over the reader; the read is journaled at its ordinal in the one cursor sequence under `ReadEntry`
  with the read's name as subject and the host's answer as its completed value, and a re-entry of the
  same invocation is served it. **The journal port gains no case:** `JournalEntry` is unchanged and a
  journal written before this phase replays unchanged; what is new is a CAPABILITY value the entries
  carry, which is the same route `RunQuery` (1905) and `ReadExtent` (1991) took. `DurableCode.EntryReadDiverged`
  = `"durable-entry-read-diverged"` and `DurableCode.entryReadDiverged subject`: the refusal a resume
  meets when its plan would read another subject at a recorded read's ordinal, or reach a stage where
  the record holds a read — naming the read, before any stage. `runWith`, `run`, `arm`, `stepVia`
  and the controls-aware forms are `runReading` over a witness that ignores the reader, and are
  unchanged in signature and behaviour.
- **Per-kind facets:** `DurableServices.declaringOpKind`, `PerformerFacets.declareOpKind`,
  `PerformerFacets.opFacetOf kinds`, `PerformerFacets.meet`, `Durable.opKinds` (the argument names an
  op's reach declares, Program's `destination` aside). The durable wrapper reads each op stage's facet
  as `opFacetOf (opKinds state op)`, so a crash inside a write declared idempotent closes its window by
  re-invoking while one inside a push declared non-idempotent is refused, under one declaration. A host
  that declared the whole performer and no kinds is read exactly as before.
- **The prefix at the performer:** `OpPrefix`, `OpPrefix.atEntry`, `OpPerformance.performedWithPrefix`,
  `OpContract.at`, `OpContract.checkAll`.
- **Proofs:** `Staging.fst` gains `entry_read` and the theorems `entry_read_served`,
  `entry_read_diverged_refused`, `entry_read_unrun_is_live`, `resumed_plan_observes_entry`;
  `proofs/oracle/Staging.fs` is re-extracted (additive); `proofs.json` gains their rows and two stated
  model-bridge assumptions; `DurableInterpreterTests` is the host.

#### What did not move

- **A host whose plan reads nothing pays nothing at run time:** `runWith` journals no read, the
  ordinals are what they were, every recorded journal decodes and replays unchanged, and the wire —
  the program wire specification, its corpus, every handler-document and demanded-document byte — is
  untouched.
- **A host that re-supplied the dead run's entry read itself keeps working** and is no longer
  required to: under `runReading` the record is Program's.
- **The facet derivation (`Facets.ofEffect` and the declaration check) keeps its signatures.** With
  no kind declared it derives exactly as before.

#### What a consumer does about it

Add the prefix argument where `Performed` is constructed or its closure called; wrap a single
contract in a list at `performedChecked`; add `OpKinds = Map.empty` to a full `PerformerFacets`
literal; rewrite a contract literal as `OpContract.at`, or add the prefix argument to its `Holds`.
A host whose plan reads the world moves to `runReading`, builds its witness over the reader under a
name of its own for the read, and drops any re-supply of the dead run's read it did by hand; a host
whose op vocabulary mixes idempotent and non-idempotent effects declares them apart with
`declaringOpKind` and names each op's kinds in its reach.

### Rides the draft: a leaf can declare itself opaque (Phase 2130)

**Class: breaking**, the class the draft already carries, so it rides `0.8.0` rather than advancing it
(no `v0.8*` tag exists, and nothing public pins `0.8.0`). `DECISIONS.md` D40 records what was decided.

- **`LeafDeclaration` gains `Opaque: OpaqueLeaf option`** (`OpaqueLeaf` is `{ Reason; Name }`): a leaf
  that is an escape no walk can see into says so, with a reason class such as `in-process`. A full
  record literal adds `Opaque = None` (FS0764 names it). Added: `LeafDeclaration.none` (declares
  nothing) and `LeafDeclaration.opaque reason name` — build from these and the next member is not a
  compile break.
- **`DemandedProjection` gains `OpaqueLeaves: OpaqueLeaf list`**, which `ofTree`, `ofAction` and
  `union` fill, distinct and sorted by reason then name. The document gains
  `"opaqueLeaves":[{"reason":…,"name":…}]` between `iterations` and `server` and moves to
  **version 8**; `decodableVersions` is `[8]`. A program whose witness declares no opaque leaf emits
  `"opaqueLeaves":[]` and nothing else in its document moves — but its bytes do, so a version-7
  document is refused by version and a signed envelope over one is re-signed. This repository's
  `conformance/demanded-effect-projection.json` moved to version 8 by hand, to exactly the encoder's
  bytes, with five vectors for the member (carried, an unknown reason class carried, missing, out of
  order, an undeclared member inside an entry); the UI tier's generator re-emits it at its raise. The
  signed envelope's drift reports an opaque leaf on either side.
- **`HostCoverage` gains `Opaque: Set<string>`** — the reason classes the host accepts running, empty
  in `HostCoverage.nothing`. Added: `HostCoverage.acceptingOpaque`. **`CoverageFinding` gains
  `UnacceptedOpaqueLeaf of reason * name`**, declared after `UncoveredStateNamespace`: every opaque
  leaf whose class the host has not accepted is reported, and no effect policy lifts it. A full
  `HostCoverage` literal adds `Opaque = Set.empty`; an exhaustive match over `CoverageFinding` gains an
  arm.

**What did not move:** every program whose witness declares no opaque leaf folds, budgets, replays,
undoes and projects exactly as before, apart from the document's version and its one empty member; no
fold path reads the declaration; the program wire specification, its corpus and every proof statement
are unchanged (the demanded document is not governed by the specification).

**What a consumer does about it:** add `Opaque = None` to a full `LeafDeclaration` literal (or build
from `LeafDeclaration.none`), `Opaque = Set.empty` to a full `HostCoverage` literal and
`OpaqueLeaves = []` to a full `DemandedProjection` literal; add an arm for `UnacceptedOpaqueLeaf` to an
exhaustive match over `CoverageFinding`; re-emit stored demanded documents and re-sign envelopes over
them. **A witness that starts declaring a leaf opaque** changes what its hosts' coverage reports: each
host reports the escape until it calls `HostCoverage.acceptingOpaque` with the class — the adopting
change states that migration for its hosts.

### Rides the draft: a plan's read is typed `Unavailable`, decoded by the store's own codec, memoised by content, and visible to the commit step (Phase 2175)

**Class: additive.** Every member below is new; no existing type gains a field or a case, no
signature moves, and no behaviour of an existing call changes. The class is read off the diff by
hand — no existing type, member or case is touched — because the shipped gate carries no surface
differ. The draft is already breaking, so an additive change rides `0.8.0` and moves no number.
`DECISIONS.md` D41 records what was decided; this entry records what a consumer pays.

#### What was added

- **The vocabulary (`ServerEffect.fs`):** `Read<'T>` (`Available of 'T` | `Unavailable of
  ReadUnavailable`), `ReadUnavailable` (`Subject`, `Cause`), `ReadCause` (`NotRead of reason` — the
  store could not be read, in the host's words — | `Undecodable of codec * reason` — the store
  answered and its own codec refused it), `ReadCodec<'T>` (`Name`, `Decode: string -> Result<'T,
  string>`), and the modules `ReadCause.describe`, `ReadUnavailable.Code` = `"read-unavailable"`,
  `ReadUnavailable.describe`, `ReadUnavailable.refusal`, `Read.toOption`, `Read.map`.
- **The run's typed reads (`Durable.fs`):** `Reads`, built per run over the run's `EntryReader`
  (`Reads.Over reader`): `Read(codec, subject, read)` journals the raw read — the content, or the
  host's reason there was none — through the entry reader under `ReadEntry`, and answers the codec's
  decode as `Read.Available` or the cause as `Read.Unavailable`; `Degraded` enumerates the run's
  unavailable reads and `Refusal ()` is the refusal a plan returns for them; `Decodes` counts the
  decodes the codecs ran. `ReadRecord` is the journal record's shape (`ContentMember`,
  `UnavailableMember`, `Malformed`, `encode`, `decode`).

#### What did not move

- **`EntryReader` keeps its shape and its journal record**, so a host on 2165's raw entry read is
  unchanged; `Reads` is a layer over it. `RunQuery` and the store-bound extent read keep their
  fail-closed halts (D41 says why). The journal port gains no case and no capability: a typed read is
  an entry read whose completed value is a `ReadRecord`. The wire — the program wire specification,
  its corpus, every handler-document and demanded-document byte — is untouched, and so is every proof
  statement: a typed read is an entry read to the durable model.

**What a consumer does about it:** nothing, unless it adopts the typed read. A host whose plan reads a
store builds `Reads.Over reader` inside the `witnessOf` it hands `Durable.runReading`, names the
store's codec as a `ReadCodec`, reads through `Read(codec, subject, read)` — returning `Error reason`
from the raw read when the store could not be read, never a default — and refuses at the plan's
commit step on `Refusal ()`. A journal a host wrote with the raw entry reader at the same subject is
not a typed read, and a typed resume over it is refused with `ReadRecord.Malformed`.

## After 0.7.1 — the UI adapters leave this repository (fuaran#2012, DECISIONS.md D32) — BREAKING for the package set

**The package set loses two packages; the four that remain do not move.** `Fuaran.Program.UI` and
`Fuaran.Program.Server.UI` moved to the UI tier's repository, which publishes them under the SAME ids
in its own lockstep version line: their next version is that tier's (a jump from 0.7.1 to its line,
recorded in its own stability file), and **0.7.1 is the last version of either published from this
repository** — this repository's publish workflow no longer packs them. The four core packages'
sources and public surface are unchanged since `v0.7.1`, so nothing here rides a draft slot or
advances `<Version>`: the next cut of this repository is a release of those four alone, whatever it
carries by then.

**What a consumer pays.**

- **A consumer of the core only** (`Fuaran.Program.Bounded`, `.Runtime`, `.Server`): nothing.
- **A consumer of an adapter**: nothing at 0.7.1, which stays published and restorable. To move past
  it, take the adapter at the UI tier's version, which pins this core at its released 0.7.1 — the same
  core bytes, now consumed by package rather than by project reference. The ids, namespaces and
  surface the adapter shipped at 0.7.1 moved file for file.
- **A consumer that took `Fuaran.UI.*` transitively through this repository's packages**: none of the
  four core packages references the UI tier (D18), so there is nothing to lose here.

## 0.7.1 — RELEASED (tagged `v0.7.1`, 2026-10-03) — what the second witness found (Phase 1967)

**Released as 0.7.1, not 0.7.0.** `0.7.0` was this slot's draft number, and drafts of it were packed and resolved while its public surface was still moving (the Phase 1967 work, then the raise onto the newest released lines). A released version names one contract, so the release takes the next patch; `0.7.0` was never tagged and never published, and no consumer should pin it. Everything below describes `0.7.1`.

**Class: breaking**, for `Fuaran.Program.Bounded` and `Fuaran.Program.Server`, and for every
consumer that constructs a witness. `v0.6.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it.

A second domain instantiated the generic tier: a handler that is a store-mutating VERB — read a
store, write and delete files, publish to a named target — run under the unmodified 0.6.0 fold with
its effects as the `'Op` of `ApplyOps`. It ran correctly and found four things it had to build beside
Program rather than get from it. `DECISIONS.md` D19 records what was decided about each; this entry
records what a consumer pays.

### What broke

- **The action view has a fifth shape.** `ActionView<'Action, 'Expr>` gains `Require of condition:
  'Expr`, the HALTING guard: the condition resolves against the store, the boolean `true` holds and
  changes nothing, and anything else halts the enclosing sequence with a refusal diagnostic. Every
  exhaustive `match` over the view in a consumer stops compiling until it names the shape; a witness's
  `View` need not produce it (the UI witness does not). A leaf's `Refuse` is unchanged and still does
  not halt.
- **`BoundedOutcome` gains `Halted: bool`.** Every full-literal construction of the outcome (FS0764)
  needs the member; `false` on every outcome the UI tier produces. `HandlerAnswer` is unchanged — an
  answered call never halts.
- **`OpWitness` gains `Reach: 'Op -> OpReach`** — the op's named arguments and its destination
  class — so every full-literal witness construction needs the member (FS0764). `OpReach.nothing` is
  the honest answer for an op that names nothing a policy can bound. The UI adapter's witness fills it
  with the nodes a tree op addresses.
- **The demanded document moves to version 5.** The server tier carries a `reach` member — present
  on every tier, `[]` where the reachable ops name nothing — and the reader reads version 5 ONLY, on
  the argument every earlier bump made. **Every signed envelope under version 4 reports `Unreadable`
  drift under this reader**, naming the version: verification is by recomputation, so a signature is
  bound to the document version as well as to the tree. Re-sign. (This repository's own K7 pin was
  re-signed; its tree-hash half is unchanged, byte for byte.)
- **`ServerArgumentPolicy.arguments` / `payloadBytes` / `check` take the op witness** as their first
  argument, because an op sequence now HAS arguments (its ops' reach) and a size (its ops' canonical
  bytes). An `AllowList` or a `Ceiling` declared on `ApplyOps` or `EmitPatch` binds, where before it
  passed vacuously. `DestinationArgument` (`"destination"`) is a reserved argument name: an op's
  destination class is allow-listed under it.
- **`Handler.run` keeps its signature; `Handler.runWith` sits beside it** and takes how the placement
  performs an op (`OpPerformance<'Op>`: `InMemory`, or `Performed of ('Op -> Result<unit, string>)`).
  `ServerServices` gains an `OpPerformance` member (`create` leaves it in memory) and the session's
  arm calls `runWith` with it. Under a registered op performer `ApplyOps` is a STAGED arm: its ops are
  applied in memory while planning and performed after the plan commits, one staged call per op in
  plan order beside the host calls; `Performed` names `ApplyOps` once per op PERFORMED, and a
  part-way failure is a `PerformFailed` under that capability with the prefix that ran reported. The
  durable interpreter runs in memory and does not journal a performed op; that is stated, not
  covered.
- **`ServerDemand` gains `Reach: OpReachDemand list`** (FS0764 on full-literal tiers), and
  `ServerDemanded.ofEffect` reads the witness.

### What did NOT change

- **The program wire.** No schema, no fixture byte and no rule of the program wire specification
  moved; the codec families and the `driver-semantics` scenarios pass byte for byte. The guard is a
  shape of the action algebra, which the specification references and does not spell. The one
  sentence of its §6.2 that a registered op performer reads past — "only `HostCall` is staged" —
  describes the in-memory placement every conformant host had and every UI host still has; carrying
  the performer case into the normative text is a specification act, deliberately not taken here
  (`docs/generic-tier.md` §6).
- **What a UI-tree program does.** Nothing at the UI witness halts (`ui_never_halts`, proved) and the
  UI adapter's ops are performed in memory, so every existing test asserts what it asserted. The UI
  demanded document moved for exactly one class of handler — one whose ops address a node — and
  moved deliberately: the reach rides the new member, at the new version.
- **The proofs.** `BoundedFold.fst` was restated over five shapes and re-proved BEFORE the port
  (D14): the four theorems keep their names and statements, the sequence homomorphism gains a halting
  clause that `fold_no_require_no_halt` makes vacuous for every view without a guard, and the UI
  corollaries are unconditional as before. `Staging.fst` models the op performer and re-proves every
  theorem over the same staged list.

### What a consumer does about it

- A consumer of UI trees takes the adapter as before; its signed envelopes are re-signed.
- A consumer with its own domain adds `Reach` to its op witness — `OpReach.nothing` is legal — names
  `ActionView.Require` in every match over the view (producing it is optional), and, if its ops reach
  the world, registers an `OpPerformance.Performed` and calls `Handler.runWith`. Its guards are
  expressions resolved against the state channel (K4); what a guard needs to read lives there.

### Rides the draft: a deny-list clause on the server argument policy (Phase 1975)

The third witness (a document pipeline under a server placement) found that a domain's LOCKED set had
no spelling in the argument policy except an allow-list over the names that existed before the run —
stale the moment a handler creates a block and then edits it. `docs/generic-tier.md` §3.5 records the
finding; this records what it costs.

- **`ServerConstraintClause` gains `DenyList of argument: string * refused: string list`** in
  `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`. An effect carrying a value under `argument` that the list names is refused
  as `ServerConstraintDefect.OffList argument` — the existing token, so `ServerArgumentPolicy.describe`
  and every refusal a host already reads are unchanged. Beside an `AllowList` on the same argument a
  name on both is refused, in either declaration order; clauses of different kinds are still checked
  in declaration order.
- **What a consumer pays.** Constructing and declaring clauses is additive: no existing clause,
  verdict or document byte moves. A consumer with an EXHAUSTIVE `match` over `ServerConstraintClause`
  stops compiling until it names the new case — a closed union gaining a case is a breaking change of
  its own, which is why this entry says so rather than calling the change additive. It rides this
  slot because the slot is already breaking and untagged: a change of no higher class than the draft
  carries does not advance it.
- **The demanded document carries it at version 5, without a move.** The clause encodes as
  `{"clause":"denyList","argument":…,"refused":[…]}` beside the others, with `refused` a sorted set. A
  move exists so a reader cannot take "predates the member" for "walked and empty"; no version-5
  producer before this clause could declare a deny-list, so a document's silence about one is true
  under every producer that wrote version 5, and a reader built before it refuses a document carrying
  one at the clause rather than misreading it. Envelopes signed under the draft need no re-sign.

### Rides the draft: the contract's three-way cut (Phase 1974)

**Class: breaking**, for every consumer that constructs a witness, registers an op performer, or
names the witness types — the same class this slot already carries, so it rides rather than
advancing. `v0.6.0` is the newest tag and nothing public pins `0.7.0`; a draft slot moves only for a
change of a HIGHER class than it carries. (The phase that filed this change expected `0.8.0`; the
draft-slot rule above is what decides, and it says ride.) The third witness (`docs/generic-tier.md`
§3.11) measured the contract and found its centre is a state with an op algebra over it, not the
tree; `DECISIONS.md` D20 records the cut.

- **`ProgramWitness` is `{ State; Walk; Dispatch }`, typed `ProgramWitness<'Node, 'Op, 'Walk,
  'Dispatch>`.** `StateWitness<'Node, 'Op>` (required — `Stream`, `Reach`, `AbsoluteTarget`,
  `Canonical`, `Diff`, `View`) replaces `OpWitness`; `WalkWitness<'Node>` (`Nodes`, `Traverse`,
  `Cost`, `QueryReaders`) and `DispatchWitness<'Node, 'Action, 'Expr, 'Store, 'Effect>` (`Handlers`,
  `Events`, `Resolve`, `Action`, `Expr`, `Store`, `Effect`) replace `TreeWitness` and the top-level
  sub-records. An unfilled position holds `Unfilled`. `FullWitness<…>` names the all-three shape.
  `TreeWitness` and `OpWitness` are gone.
- **Every core signature names the axes it reads.** The walk readers (`Budget.treeCost`,
  `QuerySchema.readersOfTree`) take a composition with a `WalkWitness`; the tree readers that also
  read handlers (`Demanded.ofTree` / `check`, `Resolve.resolveTree`, `ServerDemanded.ofTreeAndHandlers`
  and the signing/verifying wrappers, `Replay.ofTreeAndHandlers`, `Harvest.ofProgram`,
  `ServerServices.Witness`) take a `FullWitness`; the action and client-effect codecs, `HandlerWire`,
  `Replay.admit` / `postureOf` / `withPostures` and `Harvest.ofRegistration` take a composition with a
  `DispatchWitness`; `BoundedActions.run` / `runInert`, `Budget.actionCascadeCost`,
  `Demanded.ofAction`, `Handler.run` / `runWith`, `Durable.run` and `ServerDemanded.ofHandler` /
  `ofHandlers` run under every composition, reading the dispatch position through the new
  `IDispatchPosition` (`DispatchPosition.fold`). `SignedEnvelope.sign` / `verify` / `treeHash` take
  the `StateWitness`; `ServerArgumentPolicy.*` takes the `StateWitness`.
- **The op-channel guard.** `OpView` (`Edit | Require`) and `StateWitness.View`; a guard is resolved
  against the planned state, never staged or performed, and its refusal is the `ApplyOps` arm's
  `Failed` with the domain's reason verbatim. `OpView.edits` fills `View` for a domain with none.
- **The performer is handed the state.** `OpPerformance<'Node, 'Op>`; `Performed of ('Node -> 'Op ->
  Result<unit, string>)`; `performedBy` takes the same. The state is the planned state with the op
  applied. `Performed` and the `PerformFailed` prefix report are unchanged.
- **A dispatch-less composition** runs handlers of `Handler<Nothing, 'Op>` over `ServerStore<'Node,
  unit>`; a landing slot there is refused while planning as `Handler.NoBindingChannel`
  (`"no-binding-channel"`), the one new halt reason.
- **The UI adapter** exposes `UiWitness.state`, `.walk` and `.dispatch` in place of `.ops` and
  `.tree`; `UiProgramWitness` is a `FullWitness`.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte for any
composition that fills the dispatch axis, no proof statement (the staging model gained three
theorems and restated its arm; every earlier theorem keeps its statement), and the UI tier's
behaviour, byte for byte through the parity suite and the Fable leg. No envelope needs re-signing.

**What a consumer does about it:** `docs/migrations/phase-1974.md` — one page, a diff per file.

The slot stays a DRAFT: tagging `v0.7.0` is the release gesture, a separate recorded act.

### Rides the draft: selection and bounded iteration (Phase 1976)

**Class: breaking**, for every consumer that matches exhaustively on `ActionView` or `OpView`,
constructs a `StoreWitness`, or names `OpView` in a signature — the class this slot already carries,
so it rides rather than advancing. `v0.6.0` is the newest tag and nothing public pins `0.7.0`. The
second witness's re-run found the core had sequence and abort but neither the selection nor the
bounded iteration D1 and D2 charter, and `DECISIONS.md` D21 records what was decided; this entry
records what a consumer pays.

- **`ActionView` has two more shapes:** `Choose of entry: 'Expr * whenTrue: 'Action * whenFalse:
  'Action * exit: 'Expr option` and `Repeat of bound: Bound<'Expr> * body: 'Action`, with
  `Bound<'Expr> = Literal of count: int | Parameter of count: 'Expr * lo: int * hi: int`. Every
  exhaustive match over the view gains two arms (the fold, the budget, the demanded projection and
  the replay classification in this repository; any consumer's own walk).
- **`OpView` is `OpView<'Op>`** and has two more shapes: `Choose of entry: 'Op * whenTrue: 'Op list
  * whenFalse: 'Op list * exit: 'Op option` and `Repeat of count: int * body: 'Op list`.
  `StateWitness.View` is `'Op -> OpView<'Op>`; `OpView.edits` still fills it for a domain with none,
  and `OpView.beneath` enumerates the ops under a flow op.
- **`StoreWitness` gains `Read: string -> 'Store -> JVal option`** — the one member a reversible run
  uses, and the only reader of it. `Map.tryFind` for a map-shaped store; the UI adapter reads its
  `State` key back through the binding resolver.
- **The fold's new halt reasons**, each a `BoundedDiagnostic.Refused` carrying the branch's or the
  repeat's own description: `the branch condition did not resolve to a value`, an errored condition's
  own text, `the exit assertion did not hold after the true arm`, `the exit assertion held after the
  false arm`, `the exit assertion did not resolve to a value`, `the exit assertion errored: …`,
  `the repeat's bound is outside its declared range`, `… did not resolve to a count`, `… did not
  resolve to a value`, `the repeat's bound is negative`. On the op channel the `ApplyOps` arm's
  `Failed` carries `the exit assertion did not hold after the true arm: <the assertion's refusal>`,
  `the exit assertion held after the false arm`, and `the repeat's count is negative`.
- **The budget prices the shapes:** a branch at `1 + max(arms)`, a repeat at `1 + bound × body` (a
  parameter bound at the top of its range), in the saturating arithmetic the module already used.
  `Budget.satAdd` / `satMul` are unchanged in meaning and now sit above `actionCascadeCost`.
- **The argument policy reads beneath a flow op:** `ServerArgumentPolicy.reachOfOp` returns the
  reach of the op AND every op beneath it, so a branch whose untaken arm reaches an off-list path is
  refused, and the demanded document's `reach` carries both arms.
- **The reversible fragment is new API on `BoundedActions`:** `runTraced` (the fold with its
  `Trace`), `reversible` (decided from the tree), `reverse` (the inverse of a run, a `Reversed`
  program) and `runReversed`; `Trace` and `Trace.restorable` sit in `Witness.fs`. `run` and
  `runInert` are unchanged in signature and behaviour.
- **The oracle differentials** map the two shapes (`tests/*/ProofOracleTests.fs`) and the toy
  corpus covers every arm and halt of both; a consumer that mirrors those hosts gains the same arms.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte for any program
that uses neither shape (the document stays at version 5), no envelope needs re-signing, and the UI
tier's behaviour, byte for byte through the parity suite and the Fable leg — it views nothing as
either shape, proved (`ui_view_no_flow`) and tested over the arm-complete corpus. Every earlier proof
statement keeps its form except Phase 1967's "only a guard halts", which is kept as a corollary for
a view without the new shapes and generalised as `fold_no_halting_shape_no_halt`.

**What a consumer does about it:** `docs/migrations/phase-1976.md` — one page, a diff per file.

### Rides the draft: the undo posture (Phase 1977)

**Class: breaking**, for every consumer that constructs a `StateWitness` as a full literal, and
for every consumer that reads the demanded document or verifies a signed envelope — the class this
slot already carries, so it rides rather than advancing. `v0.6.0` is the newest tag and nothing
public pins `0.7.0`. `DECISIONS.md` D22 records what was decided; this entry records what a consumer
pays.

- **`StateWitness` gains `Undo: 'Op -> UndoClass<'Node, 'Op>`**, with `UndoClass = Inverse of
  ('Node -> 'Op list) | Compensate of ('Node -> 'Op list) | OneWay of reason: string`. A
  full-literal construction gains one line (`FS0764` names it). What to answer: an exact inverse
  computed from the pre-state for an edit that has one, a declared compensation for one that can
  be undone in effect only, and `OneWay` with the domain's reason for a push. The UI adapter
  answers every tree op an exact inverse through `TreeOpDiff.diff`; the obligation an `Inverse`
  carries is K9 (`docs/generic-tier.md` §3.7), and the undo run refuses a witness that breaks it.
- **The demanded document moves to version 6:** the server tier carries `undo`, one posture per
  reachable handler (`{"handler":…,"undo":"reversible"|"compensable"|"one-way"|"unknown",
  "reasons":[{"stage":n,"defect":…}]}`), present and empty where no handler contributed.
  `Demanded.decodableVersions` is `[6]`: a version-5 document is refused naming the version, never
  read through this lens. Every envelope signed under version 5 reports `Unreadable` drift naming
  the version; a re-sign is the remedy, and this repository's K7 pin was re-signed over the same
  tree.
- **`ServerDemand` gains `Undo: UndoPosture list`**, so a full-literal construction of a server
  tier gains one line; `UndoPosture` and `UndoReasonDemand` are new in `Demanded.fs`.
- **New API on the server placement:** `Handler.runPlanned` (the outcome beside the `UndoPlan` a
  run leaves — `UndoStep.Edit | Compute | Reached | Emitted`), `Undo.posture` / `reasons` /
  `postureOf` / `withPostures` / `ofTreeAndHandlers`, and `Undo.run` with its `UndoRefusal`
  (`undo-one-way-step`, `undo-undecidable-step`, `undo-inverse-drift`, `undo-uncommitted-plan`).
  `Harvest.ofProgram` and `ofRegistration` join the undo posture beside the replay posture.
- **`Handler.runWith` and `run` are unchanged in signature**; the compute stage now runs the fold
  traced, which `traced_agrees` and the parity suite say answers the same outcome.
- **The oracle project gains `Undo.fs`** (generated from `proofs/Undo.fst`) and the proof leg a
  fifth module; `Staging.fs` is re-extracted for the trail.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member of the program wire specification, no fixture byte, and
the UI tier's behaviour, byte for byte through the parity suite and the Fable leg. A demanded
document for a program with no server tier changes only its version number; one with a server tier
gains `"undo":[]` where no handler contributed. Every earlier proof statement keeps its form.

**What a consumer does about it:** `docs/migrations/phase-1977.md` — one page, a diff per file.

### Rides the draft: a performed op is journaled like a host call (Phase 1980)

**Class: breaking**, for a consumer that constructs a `JournalEntry` or a `PerformerFacets` as a
full literal (a host's persistent effect journal; nothing in this repository outside the two files
that define them), and for every caller of the facet derivation — the class this slot already
carries, so it rides rather than advancing. `v0.6.0` is the newest tag and nothing public pins
`0.7.0`. `DECISIONS.md` D23 records what was decided and why the specification does not move; this
entry records what a consumer pays.

- **`JournalEntry` gains `Subject: string option`** — `None` for a host call; for a performed op
  stage the content address (`sha256:` + digest) of the op's canonical form, off the state axis's
  `Stream.Encode`. A host whose journal persists entries stores and returns the member; `Journal.none`
  and `Journal.inMemory` already do. `Journal.subjectOf` reads it beside `capabilityOf`, and
  `Journal.describe` renders it between the capability and the phase tag for an op stage only, so
  every host-call line a reader pinned reads as it did.
- **`PerformerFacets` gains `OpPerformer: IdempotencyFacet option`**, with
  `PerformerFacets.declareOpPerformer` / `isOpPerformerDeclared` / `opPerformerFacet` and
  `DurableServices.declaringOpPerformer`. Undeclared reads `NonIdempotent`, as an undeclared host
  function does.
- **`Durable.runWith` sits beside `Durable.run`** and takes the placement's `OpPerformance` after its
  registry; `run` is `runWith` in memory, unchanged in signature and behaviour. Under a registered op
  performer every op stage is journaled under `ApplyOps` at its ordinal in the ONE sequence the host
  calls share — attempted before the performer, decided after — served on replay, refused undecided
  by default, re-invoked only under `acceptingIndeterminateReplay` (an `Overrides` record under
  `ApplyOps`) or a performer declared `Idempotent`, and refused as `durable-replay-divergence` where
  a recorded ordinal holds another op. `Durable.arm` passes the host's `ServerServices.OpPerformance`,
  so a session's durable step covers its ops with no change at the call site. `DurableControls.runWith`
  is the same beside `DurableControls.run`. `Durable.opSubject` and `Durable.OpStageCapability` are
  new and public, so a host can compute the subject it will find in its journal.
- **The facet derivation takes the performance:** `Facets.ofEffect` / `ofHandler` / `ofHandlers` /
  `declare` / `checkDeclaration` and `Durable.guarantees` / `declaration` / `checkDeclaration` gain
  an `OpPerformance<'Node, 'Op>` argument before the handler(s). Pass `OpPerformance.InMemory` to
  keep every answer a caller had; pass the registered performance and `ApplyOps` is derived on a host
  call's terms — strict may lose, accepting may duplicate, exactly-once only where the op performer
  is declared idempotent — with `checkDeclaration` reporting an undeclared op performer as
  `facet-undeclared-performer` under `ApplyOps`. `Facets.undeclaredOpPerformer` is new.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte, no envelope
needs re-signing, and the UI tier byte for byte through the parity suite and the Fable leg — in memory
nothing is performed and nothing new is journaled, which `DurableInterpreterTests` pins against the
journal's own rendering. The program wire specification is unchanged (D23 item 5: the journal is a
host port, not a wire artefact; §7.1 is checked and holds). Every earlier proof statement keeps its
form; `Staging.fst` gains the durable discipline — eight theorems over the same staged list — and its
extraction is re-emitted for them.

**What a consumer does about it:** a host with a persistent journal adds `Subject` to its entry
construction (`None` where it has only ever journaled host calls); a domain whose ops reach the world
calls `Durable.runWith` with the performance it already hands `Handler.runWith`, declares its op
performer's idempotency, and passes the same performance to the facet derivation; a UI-tier consumer
changes nothing.

### Rides the draft: an op performer's claim is checked (Phase 1981)

**Class: breaking**, for every consumer that registers an op performer — the payload of
`OpPerformance.Performed` changes type — which is the class this slot already carries, so it rides
rather than advancing. `v0.6.0` is the newest tag and nothing public pins `0.7.0`. `DECISIONS.md` D24
records what was decided and why the specification does not move; this entry records what a consumer
pays.

- **`OpPerformance.Performed` carries `'Node -> 'Op -> Result<Fuaran.Core.JVal, string>`** — the
  performer answers a RECEIPT, what it says it did, instead of `unit`. `OpPerformance.performedBy`
  takes the receipt-answering shape. A performer with nothing to say registers through the new
  `OpPerformance.performedWithoutReceipt`, whose receipt is the inert empty object the staged call
  always answered — the one-line migration for every existing caller.
- **`OpContract<'Node, 'Op>` is new** — `{ Name; Holds: 'Node -> 'Op -> JVal -> bool }` — with
  `OpContract.describe` (`return-contract:<name>`, the vocabulary `ReturnContract.describe` has) and
  `OpContract.check`. **`OpPerformance.performedChecked contract perform`** registers a performer with
  its contract composed, on `ServerEffectRegistry.registerChecked`'s terms: a receipt the contract
  rejects is `PerformFailed("ApplyOps", "return-contract:<name>")`, the handler rolled back and the op
  absent from `Performed`.
- **The durable journal records the receipt** as an op stage's `Completed` value, and a
  contract-rejected receipt as `Refused` at its ordinal; a host reading its journal's values for op
  stages sees the receipt where it saw `{}`. `Durable.runWith`'s signature is unchanged.
- **`Handler.runWith` / `Handler.run` / `Durable.run` / the facet derivation** are unchanged in
  signature; the facets read `Performed _` and are indifferent to the payload.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte, no envelope
needs re-signing, and the UI tier byte for byte through the parity suite and the Fable leg —
`InMemory` is untouched. The program wire specification is unchanged (D24 item 6). Every earlier proof
statement keeps its form; `EffectGate.fst` gains `op_contract` / `check_op` and the theorems
`check_op_is_check_return`, `op_token_checked`, `op_return_contract` and `uncontracted_is_direct`, and
its extraction is re-emitted for them.

**What a consumer does about it:** a domain whose op performer answered `Ok ()` wraps it in
`OpPerformance.performedWithoutReceipt` and changes nothing else; a domain whose policy is enforced
against reach has its performer answer what it touched and registers through `performedChecked` with
a contract that reads the receipt against the op's reach (the in-repo verb witness's
`Receipt.withinReach` is the pattern); a UI-tier consumer changes nothing.

### Rides the draft: the outcome names its arms, a state-only handler document, and a numeric ceiling (Phase 1982)

**Class: breaking**, the class this slot already carries, so it rides rather than advancing: `v0.6.0`
is the newest tag and nothing public pins `0.7.0`. `DECISIONS.md` D25 records what was decided and
why neither the specification nor any theorem statement moves.

- **`HandlerOutcome` gains `Flow: FlowDecision list`**, and `HandlerTally` gains the same member, so
  every full-literal construction of either needs it (FS0764). `[]` is the honest value for a
  handler that uses no branch and no repeat. `FlowDecision` (`Chose of bool` | `Repeated of int`) and
  `FlowDecision.ofTrace` are new.
- **`ServerConstraintClause` gains `AtMost of argument: string * limit: int`**, so every exhaustive
  match over the clause stops compiling until it names the case. The demanded document carries it as
  `{"clause":"atMost","argument":…,"limit":…}` at version 6 (no version move).
- **`ServerArgumentPolicy.arguments` reads a host call's integer members** as decimal text, beside its
  string members. An allow-list or deny-list declared on such a name now binds where it passed
  vacuously before.
- **`HandlerWire`'s codecs, `Replay`'s functions and `Harvest.ofRegistration` take the dispatch
  position at any composition** (`#IDispatchPosition`) where they took `DispatchWitness`. Every
  existing caller compiles unchanged.
- **New public members:**
  - `HandlerWire.contentAddress`;
  - `SignedEnvelope.signAddressed` / `verifyAddressed`;
  - `ProgramWire.decodeActionIn` / `replayDefectsOfActionIn`.
- **`SignedEnvelope.sign` / `verify`** keep their signatures and their bytes. `verify` now
  evaluates the walk before the key checks rather than after, which a pure walk cannot observe.

**What did NOT change:**
- no wire member, no fixture byte, and no outcome-document byte (`HandlerReport` does not carry
  `Flow`);
- no demanded-document byte for any registry that declares no `AtMost`;
- no envelope needs re-signing, and no proof statement moves;
- the UI tier, byte for byte through the parity suite and the Fable leg.

**What a consumer does about it:**
- A full-literal `HandlerOutcome` or `HandlerTally` gains `Flow = []`.
- An exhaustive match over `ServerConstraintClause` gains the `AtMost` arm.
- A domain that fills only the state axis can now encode, address and sign its handlers. It gives
  its `Stream.Decode` the inverse of `Stream.Encode` if it had none.
- A UI-tier consumer changes nothing.

### Rides the draft: the op performer is revocable (Phase 1983)

**Class: additive** — new members, and one refusal path that a session reaches only by recording a
revoke of the reserved key. It rides the draft rather than advancing it: `v0.6.0` is the newest tag
and nothing public pins `0.7.0`. `DECISIONS.md` D26 records what was decided and why.

- **`OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`** (`"ApplyOps"`) is new: the reserved key an operator's revoke
  names the op performer by — `Controls.revoke actor reason OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`. No
  registration shape changes; `performedBy` / `performedChecked` / `performedWithoutReceipt` and the
  `OpPerformance` cases are as Phase 1981 left them.
- **`Controls.opPerformerRevocation`, `Controls.opStageRefusal` and `Controls.performance`** are new.
  `Controls.performance record state performance` is the direct interpreter's half beside
  `Controls.apply`: a host running `Handler.runWith` under its own controls passes its op performance
  through it, as it passes its registry through `apply`.
- **`DurableControls.runWith` / `arm` / `stepVia` refuse an op stage once the op performer is
  revoked** — at the stage's ordinal, before it is attempted, as
  `PerformFailed("ApplyOps", "control-performer-revoked")` with the prefix that ran reported, and a
  `ControlRefusal.Revoked("ApplyOps", actor, reason)` in `Refusals`. A refused stage writes no
  effect-journal entry; a resumed run serves its recorded prefix and refuses the first unrecorded
  op stage. Their signatures are unchanged, and so are `Durable.runWith` / `run` / `arm`.
- **A behaviour a host already recording revokes can observe:** a session whose stream ALREADY holds
  a revoke of `"ApplyOps"` (a host function of that name, before this phase) now also has its op
  stages refused. One revoke withdraws both arms; that is the over-broad direction, deliberately.
- **`Controls.describeRefusal` renders a revocation as "'<capability>' refused — its performer was
  withdrawn by …"** where it said "reads as unregistered": true of a host call, false of an op stage,
  so the one rendering now says what holds of both. A log-safe string, not a wire member.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte, the control
stream's encoding, `Controls.step` (no arm removes a key from `Revoked`; monotonicity unchanged), no
proof statement, and the UI tier byte for byte — in memory there is no op performer to withdraw. A
session that records no revoke of the key runs byte-identically, in memory and durably, journal
entry for entry.

**What a consumer does about it:** nothing, unless it means to withdraw ops. An operator does so with
`Controls.revoke actor reason OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`. A host that drives the direct
interpreter under its own controls adds `Controls.performance` beside its `Controls.apply`.

### Rides the draft: coverage reads the op performer (Phase 1986)

**Class: breaking, for one member** — `Controls.coverage` gains a parameter. It rides the draft
rather than advancing it: the draft is already of the breaking class (see the head of this entry),
`v0.6.0` is the newest tag and nothing public pins `0.7.0`. `DECISIONS.md` D28 records what was
decided and why, including why the parameter was preferred to a second function.

- **`Controls.coverage state registry performance`** — the placement's `OpPerformance` is the new
  third argument. A call site that passed two arguments stops compiling until it names how its
  placement performs ops; `OpPerformance.InMemory` reproduces the old answer exactly.
- **`DurableControls.coverage controls host` keeps its signature** and reads `host.OpPerformance`
  from the host record it already took.
- **A behaviour a host can observe:** under `OpPerformance.Performed`, once the op performer is
  revoked (`Controls.revoke actor reason OpPerformance.RegistrationKey`), coverage's gate refuses
  `ApplyOps`, so a demanded-effect check over a handler that carries an op reports
  `CoverageFinding.ServerGateRefusesCapability "ApplyOps"` where it reported nothing. That is the
  revoke's effect being reported, not a new effect: the op stage was already refused at run time
  (Phase 1983). Under `OpPerformance.InMemory` nothing changes — the apply is the effect and there
  is nothing to withdraw.

**What did NOT change:** `ServerCoverage`, `CoverageFinding` and `Demanded.checkProjection` (no
member, no arm), no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte, the control stream,
`Controls.step` and its monotonicity, no proof statement. With the op performer not revoked, coverage
is the registry's coverage under the controls exactly as before, whatever else is in force.

**What a consumer does about it:** a direct caller of `Controls.coverage` passes its placement's
op performance as the third argument (`OpPerformance.InMemory` if it performs none). A consumer that
branches on coverage findings should expect `ApplyOps` in a gate finding when an operator has
withdrawn the op performer; D28 says why it is a gate finding rather than an absence.

### Rides the draft: `Each` over a literal collection (Phase 1990)

**Class: breaking**, for every consumer that matches exhaustively on `ActionView`, `OpView`, `Trace`
or `FlowDecision`, constructs an `ActionWitness` or a `StateWitness`, or calls `OpView.beneath` — the
class this slot already carries, so it rides rather than advancing. `v0.6.0` is the newest tag and
nothing public pins `0.7.0`. A loop whose body depends on which iteration it is in could not be
written (D21 gave `Repeat` no index, for the reversal argument); `DECISIONS.md` D29 records what was
decided; this entry records what a consumer pays.

- **`ActionView` has an eighth shape:** `Each of collection: JVal list * placeholder: string * body:
  'Action` — per-element iteration over a LITERAL collection, lowered by substitution: the body runs
  once per element with that element written over the placeholder, as a sequence. Every exhaustive
  match over the view gains an arm (the fold, the budget, the demanded projection, the replay
  classification, the fragment and the inverse in this repository; any consumer's own walk).
- **`OpView<'Op>` has a fifth shape:** `Each of collection: JVal list * placeholder: string * body:
  'Op list`. `OpView.edits` still fills `View` for a domain with none.
- **`ActionWitness` gains `Substitute: string -> JVal -> 'Action -> 'Action` and `Placeholders:
  'Action -> string list`; `StateWitness` gains `Substitute: string -> JVal -> 'Op -> 'Op` and
  `Placeholders: 'Op -> string list`** (FS0764 on every full-literal construction). `Substitute`
  writes an element over a placeholder throughout the action or op — the domain's own recursion — and
  is called only when an `Each` is met; `Placeholders` answers the names a node's OWN operands read,
  for the scope check. A domain with no placeholders fills them with `fun _ _ x -> x` and `fun _ ->
  []`, which is what the UI adapter does. The obligation on `Substitute` — the substituted action or
  op views as the original does, shape for shape — is stated in `proofs/README.md` and tested at the
  toy witness.
- **`OpView.beneath` takes the substitution:** `beneath view substitute op`, because the ops beneath
  an `Each` are its SUBSTITUTED elements — the policy must see every address a placeholder stands for.
  `ServerArgumentPolicy.reachOfOp` passes the state witness's; a consumer calling `beneath` directly
  adds the argument. `OpView.lowered` / `StateWitness.lowered` / `ActionWitness.lowered` are the
  lowered forms, public.
- **`Trace` gains `Each of elements: Trace list`** — the elements that ran, under their own
  constructor; `Trace.restorable` reads it; the inverse of an `Each` run is a `Reversed.Sequence`.
  **`FlowDecision` gains `Iterated of count: int`**, reported from both axes.
- **Two new refusals, both at validation and never mid-run**, each a `BoundedDiagnostic.Refused` (the
  fold, carrying the program's description) or the `ApplyOps` arm's `Failed` (the handler): `placeholder
  '<name>' is read outside any Each that binds it` and `placeholder '<name>' is already bound by an
  enclosing Each`. `BoundedActions.run` / `runTraced` refuse at entry with nothing run; `Handler`'s
  op planning refuses before its first op. `ScopeDefect` and the static walks
  (`BoundedActions.scopeDefects`, `StateWitness.scopeDefects`, `OpView.scopeDefects`,
  `ActionWitness.scopeDefects`) are public, for a host that validates at registration.
- **The budget prices an `Each` as its lowered form** — the body's cost once per element, summed, no
  step for a bound — so the driver's gate refuses an over-size `Each` before its first element.
- **The oracle differentials** map the shape lowered (`tests/*/ProofOracleTests.fs`); the toy corpus
  covers it; the verb domain carries placeholders as `{name}` tokens in its paths and the toy's
  expressions as `Hole`.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no refusal class of the program wire
specification (D29 item 6: the specification references the action and op algebras and does not
spell their shapes; a compute stage's action and an effect's ops travel in the DOMAIN's codec), no
demanded-document byte for any program that uses no `Each` (the document stays at version 6), no
envelope needs re-signing, and the UI tier's behaviour, byte for byte through the parity suite and
the Fable leg — it views nothing as an `Each` (`ui_view_no_flow`, proved and tested over the
arm-complete corpus) and never substitutes. Every earlier proof statement keeps its form; `Each`
takes the sequence's case in each.

**What a consumer does about it:** `docs/migrations/phase-1990.md` — one page, a diff per file.

### Rides the draft: the substrate and the UI tier at their newest releases (2026-10-03)

**Class: breaking, at the dependency floor.** The draft already carries that class, so this rides it.
A change to the contract a package was BUILT against counts here as a change to its own contract
(the versioning policy above). `v0.6.0` is the newest tag, and nothing public pins `0.7.0`.

**The pins move:**
- `Fuaran.UI.*`: `0.86.0` → `0.90.0`.
- `Fuaran.Core.*`: `0.32.0` → `0.34.0`.
- **The evaluator moves to its new id.** `Fuaran.Core.DataFrame` `0.34.0` becomes
  `Fuaran.Compute.DataFrame` `0.37.0`, the id and namespace Core-Compute took at `0.36.0` (its
  DECISIONS D4).

These are the newest released lines, and they agree with each other: `Fuaran.UI` `0.90.0` is built
on exactly `Fuaran.Core` `0.34.0` and `Fuaran.Compute.DataFrame` `0.37.0`.

**What a consumer meets:**
- **The evaluator's types live in `Fuaran.Compute`.** That covers `ColExpr`, `Transform`,
  `EvalError` and `Slot` with their cases, and the `DataFrame` module itself. `DataSource`,
  `Table`, `Cell` and the JSON types stay in `Fuaran.Core`. A file that names them adds
  `open Fuaran.Compute`, or writes `Fuaran.Compute.` where it wrote `Fuaran.Core.`.
- **`ServerEffect.RunQuery` takes the new types.** Its pipeline is `Fuaran.Compute.Transform list`,
  and a query's failure is a `Fuaran.Compute.EvalError`.
- **`ColExpr` gained `Quotient` and `Rounded`** (Core-Compute `0.36.0`). The static query-schema
  walk reads their operands' columns. A consumer's own exhaustive match over `ColExpr` names both.
- **A consumer of the UI adapters raises the UI tier to `0.90.0`**, since the adapters are built
  against it.

**What did NOT change:** no wire member, no fixture byte, no demanded-document byte, no proof
statement, and no envelope needs re-signing.

## 0.6.0 — RELEASED (tagged `v0.6.0`, 2026-09-28) — the core becomes domain-generic (Phase 1896)

**Class: breaking**, for `Fuaran.Program.Bounded`, `Fuaran.Program.Runtime` and
`Fuaran.Program.Server`. `v0.5.0` is tagged, so this cannot ride it.

### What broke

- **The public types gain type parameters.** The three core packages are rebuilt over the witness
  contract of `DECISIONS.md` D18 (`docs/generic-tier.md` §3): one record, `ProgramWitness<'Node,
  'Action, 'Expr, 'Store, 'Op, 'Effect>`, supplies what the algebra asks of a domain, and every type
  that used to name a UI-tier type names a type parameter instead — `BoundedOutcome<'Store,
  'Effect>`, `HandlerArm<'Store, 'Effect, 'Placement>`, `ServerEffect<'Op>`, `Handler<'Action,
  'Op>`, `ServerStore<'Node, 'Store>`, `ServerSession<…>`, `ServerStepOutput<…>`,
  `EffectRegistry<'Effect>` and the rest. The functions over them take the witness (or the part of
  it they read) as their first argument: `BoundedActions.run witness arm nodeId action store
  placement`.
- **The UI tier leaves the dependency graph.** None of the three packages references a
  `Fuaran.UI.*` package any more, declared or transitive, and a test fails if one returns. They name
  the substrate they use directly instead: `Fuaran.Core.Wire`, `.Column`, `.DataFrame`, `.Tree` and
  `.OpStream` — the evaluator at the Core-Compute release 0.34.0, the rest at the 0.32.0 it
  declares. That is the substrate the UI tier this repository now pins (0.86.0) was built on, and
  it is a raise from the 0.21.0 the packages received through the UI tier before: `RunQuery` runs
  the 0.34.0 evaluator, which is linear where 0.21.0 was badly super-linear
  (`docs/runquery-benchmark.md`). A consumer that pins `Fuaran.Core.*` itself meets the substrate's
  own changes at these versions — `Transform.Limit` / `Sort` take slots, `ColExpr` gained `Now`,
  `EvalError` gained `UnpinnedClock` (`docs/dataframe-0.34-surface-diff.md`).
- **The UI-typed transport leaves the core.** The bounded driver, its channel glue and the client
  runtime (`BoundedDriver`, `BoundedConnection`, `Program`), the client-effect destination map, the
  UI's URL floor in the egress classification, and the server session's and durable interpreter's
  EVENT step are UI transport rather than algebra (K8). The core session now starts at
  `ServerSession.dispatchWith` — an action already chosen — and the durable steps take the
  transport's step as a function (`Durable.stepVia`, `DurableControls.stepVia`).
- **The replay classification reads the view** (`ProgramWire.replayDefectsOfAction witness action`)
  instead of an encoded action's wire tags; for every action an encoder can produce, the verdicts
  are unchanged.
- `EffectDestination` is now declared in the core's contract file (same namespace,
  `Fuaran.Program.Runtime`); `EgressPolicy.classify` became `EgressPolicy.classifyWith floor`.

### What did NOT change

- **The program wire.** No schema, no fixture byte and no rule of the program wire specification
  moved: the conformance corpus's codec families and driver-semantics scenarios pass byte for byte,
  run through the generic core and the UI adapter.
- **What a UI-tree program does**, with ONE exception below that comes from the UI tier, not from
  this change. Every other existing test runs, unchanged in what it asserts, through the UI
  instantiation. The signed effect envelope's tree hash moved from the UI tier's SHA-256 to Core's;
  an envelope signed before the move is pinned as a test and still verifies (K7).

### A behaviour a consumer of UI trees inherits from the UI tier raise

The UI tier (0.86.0) resolves a state binding with NO declared default, at a slot nothing has
written, as UNRESOLVED; until then it resolved to the empty value. The adapter follows the tier. On
the bounded path that shows in two places a tree can observe: a `WriteToClipboard` whose payload is
such a binding is now REFUSED (nothing copied, one `Refused` diagnostic) where it copied `""`, and a
`SetState` taking its `valueFrom` from such a binding now performs no write and is diagnosed
("valueFrom did not resolve to a value") where it wrote the empty value. Both are pinned by tests.
**What to do:** give the binding a default — `Binding.State(key, Some default)`
resolves to the default at an unwritten slot, and is copied.

### What a consumer does about it

- **A consumer of UI trees** takes the UI adapter — `Fuaran.Program.UI` (Fable-clean) and
  `Fuaran.Program.Server.UI` (.NET) — and adds `open Fuaran.Program.UI` (and
  `open Fuaran.Program.Server.UI`) AFTER its `open Fuaran.Program.*` lines. The adapter keeps the
  pre-0.6.0 names as closed aliases and partially applied modules (`BoundedStore`,
  `BoundedActions.runBoundedAction`, `ServerSession.step`, …), so most call sites do not change.
- **A consumer with its own domain** builds a `ProgramWitness` for it and calls the core directly.
  What each member is assumed to be, and which proved law leans on it, is `proofs/README.md`'s
  "Every parameter of the model is an assumption".

### The core and its adapter release together

The UI adapter is new at `0.6.0` and ships in the same version as the core it instantiates: **no
`0.6.0` core is released without its adapter.** `0.6.0` is ONE version across all six packages —
`Fuaran.Program`, `.Bounded`, `.Runtime`, `.Server` and the two adapter packages
`Fuaran.Program.UI` and `Fuaran.Program.Server.UI` — single-sourced from `<Version>` like the rest,
packed by the same `-Pack` leg and published by the same tag.

**Class: additive**, for the two adapter packages (Phase 1897). Phase 1896 wrote their sources in
two non-packable projects under `tests/`; Phase 1897 moved them, file for file, to
`src/Fuaran.Program.UI/` and `src/Fuaran.Program.Server.UI/` and made them packable. Their public
surface is exactly what the existing suite, the scenario corpus and the sample already ran through,
so the move changes no behaviour; it rides this draft slot rather than advancing it. The core
boundary test covers the new neighbours: no core package may reference an adapter package, declared
or resolved, any more than it may reference the UI tier itself.

The slot was released as `v0.6.0` on 2026-09-28, all six packages at one version.

**Class: additive**, for `Fuaran.Program.Server` (Phase 1759). `ServerEffect.fs` gains a
`ReturnContract` record (`Name`, `Holds`) with `ReturnContract.describe` / `check`, and
`ServerEffectRegistry.registerChecked fn contract performer registry`, which registers
`ReturnContract.check contract performer` under `fn`. `ServerEffectRegistry` itself is unchanged —
no field, so every full-literal construction still compiles — and `register` is unchanged, so a
consumer that declares no contract sees no difference. It rides this draft slot. The behaviour it
adds is proved (`proofs/EffectGate.fst`, `return_contract`): a result the contract rejects reaches
the handler as `PerformFailed` naming the contract, never as a value.

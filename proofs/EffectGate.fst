/// Phase 1759 — the effect gate is provably sufficient for a declared
/// policy: the performer boundary moves from trusted to constrained.
///
/// # What this module is
///
/// The gate half of `Handler.run`
/// (`src/Fuaran.Program.Server/Handler.fs`, `runEffect` and `perform`),
/// read against SCIO*'s split — an executable access-control check Π
/// run before every operation, a policy specification Σ over the ghost
/// trace, a monitor state with an `abstracts` relation to the trace,
/// and proofs that Π implies Σ and that every operation preserves the
/// abstraction. The perform path itself is NOT re-modelled here: Phase
/// 1717's `Staging.fst` already models `runEffect`, the phase boundary
/// and `perform` clause for clause with the performer abstract, and this
/// module `open`s it and proves over its definitions. What is new at
/// runtime is ONE definition — `check_return`, the return-contract wrapper
/// `ServerEffectRegistry.registerChecked` composes with a performer at
/// registration (`src/Fuaran.Program.Server/ServerEffect.fs`,
/// `ReturnContract.check`) — and the differential host
/// (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Server.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs`, the
/// `Phase 1759` list) runs its extraction beside production.
///
/// Where SCIO*'s pieces land in this estate's shape:
///
///   * Π is `ServerEffectRegistry.Gate : string -> bool`, consulted on
///     the CAPABILITY (`ServerEffect.capability`) before anything else —
///     the first clause of `runEffect`, `plan_effect` in the model.
///   * Σ is `policy_spec`: a predicate over the ghost trace of the
///     capabilities that reached the interpreter's state or a performer.
///     Phase 1739's argument constraints are an instance; Phase 1744's
///     signed envelope is the declared Σ an operator signs.
///   * The monitor state is `monitor`, and it is EMPTY — see the finding
///     below.
///   * Traces stay ghost: `ghost_trace` is `noextract`, and nothing is
///     added at runtime beyond the wrapper.
///
/// # The finding the model records
///
/// Production's gate reads the capability name and NOTHING ELSE: no
/// history, no count, no state. SCIO*'s monitor state — what Π is
/// allowed to read, and what `abstracts` ties to the trace — is therefore
/// the trivial one here, `Stateless`, and `abstracts` holds of every
/// trace. The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a stateless Π is
/// sufficient for exactly the Σ that are INDUCTIVE under it — `Σ []`, and
/// `Σ tr /\ Π c ==> Σ (tr ++ [c])` (`sufficient_for`). "Only the effects
/// in envelope E" and "only to the endpoints in allow-list A" are of that
/// class; "at most B host calls per handler" is NOT, and no proof over
/// this gate can reach it. Phase 1716's budget bounds the FOLD's steps,
/// not the effects' count. The stronger statement — a gate that takes a
/// monitor state, `Π : m -> string -> bool`, with `abstracts m tr` and the
/// preservation obligation on every update — is proposed in
/// `proofs/README.md` and needs the production gate to take a state
/// before it can be proved of anything.
///
/// # The theorems
///
///   * `gate_before_perform` — one effect the gate refuses: the planned
///     accumulator is halted, carries EXACTLY ONE new diagnostic, the
///     denial naming the capability (and, by its type, nothing else), and
///     is EQUAL under every lookup, every performer behaviour, every
///     argument policy and every witness — the refusal is decided before
///     any of them is read. `gate_refusal_halts_run` lifts it to the
///     handler: a refused stage rolls the handler back to the entry
///     store, reports nothing performed, appends that one denial to the
///     diagnostics the stages before it produced, and the outcome is the
///     same whatever follows the refused stage and whatever the
///     performers would have answered.
///   * `policy_sufficient` — for a declared Σ with `sufficient_for Π Σ`,
///     every trace the handler produces satisfies Σ: the ghost trace of
///     everything that reached the state or a performer, and `Performed`
///     as the outcome reports it (the whole trace on commit, the
///     performed host calls on rollback). Quantified over every
///     performer, every witness, every program and every entry store —
///     the performer is an abstract parameter, and that quantification
///     is the point.
///   * `return_contract` — with a contract declared on a performer, a
///     result it answers is check_return against that contract BEFORE it
///     reaches the store (`perform_store`: the bindings are exactly the
///     landed results folded through `Assign`, and `landed_honour`: every
///     landed result honours its contract), and a result the contract
///     rejects is a typed refusal — `PerformFailed` naming the capability
///     and the contract's name, never the value — at that position, with
///     the handler rolled back and `Performed` exactly the calls before
///     it. SCIO*'s `import` wrapper, re-expressed as the F# check whose
///     sufficiency this is.
///
/// Every theorem is conditional on the witness and the registry arrows
/// exactly as `Staging.fst`'s are: they are the assumed rung, and the
/// theorems are quantified over them.

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The op performer's receipt — Phase 1981. `return_contract` is stated
   over every staged call, and since Phase 1967 the staged list holds op
   stages beside host calls, each an opaque token the perform phase
   applies through `r_perf`; so the theorem already covers an op stage
   whose token carries a contract. What follows makes that reading
   VISIBLE and USABLE in the op's own vocabulary — the planned state, the
   op and the receipt — and proves that the uncontracted performer is the
   performer there was.

.SYNOPSIS
    The whole proof leg for every model under proofs/ — Phase 1715's
    bounded-fold theorem, Phase 1716's budget theorem, Phase 1717's
    staging theorem, Phase 1759's effect-gate theorem and Phase 1977's
    undo theorem.

.DESCRIPTION
    Self-contained and runnable from the repository root:

        pwsh ./proofs/check.ps1

    Six steps, in this order, each refusing rather than warning. Steps
    2-4 and 6 run once PER MODULE in `$modules` below; step 5 builds the
    one oracle project every extraction compiles into.

      1. Resolve the pinned F* release named in `fstar-pin.json` — an
         existing $env:FSTAR_HOME first, then a previous download under
         `proofs/.fstar/`, then a fresh download whose SHA-256 must match
         the pin.
      2. CHECK each module on it, with `--report_assumes error` so an
         `assume` or an `admit` fails the leg rather than quietly
         weakening a theorem.
      3. EXTRACT each to F# from the checked cache.
      4. BYTE-DIFF each extraction against its committed `oracle/*.fs`.
         This is the step that makes the committed file trustworthy:
         the repository builds and tests against a copy, and this says
         the copy is what the prover produced.
      5. BUILD the oracle project, so a committed extraction that no
         longer compiles is caught here rather than in someone else's
         gate.
      6. RUN each module's differential hosts — Expecto lists inside
         the test projects the module names, each running the extracted
         model beside production and requiring them to agree. Since
         fuaran#2017 every module's FIRST host is in
         `Fuaran.Program.Tests`, at the toy witness, in a project that
         reaches no UI type: that is the host its claims name. Since
         fuaran#2012 it is the ONLY host: the UI adapters left the
         repository, and the second hosts at the UI witness went with them
         (the two claims about the adapter's own code are hosted beside it
         now, over byte copies of BoundedFold.fst and Budget.fst and their
         extractions — see proofs.json `repo`). Skippable with
         `-SkipHost`, because it needs the solution built and the proof
         half does not — and the toy-family hosts need the conformance
         corpus (`FUARAN_PROGRAM_SPEC` or the sibling clone), exactly as
         `run.ps1` does.

    Two things about reproducibility are worth knowing before reading
    the flags.

    **Proof hints no longer exist.** `--record_hints` and `--use_hints`
    were removed from F*, so the usual way of pinning a proof's SMT
    search is unavailable. What replaces it is the PIN (this is why
    `fstar-pin.json` records the release, its hash, and the bundled Z3
    version), a MARGIN on `--z3rlimit` well above what any query here
    needs, and `--quake`, which re-runs every query under different
    seeds and fails unless it succeeds every time. `-Runs N` repeats the
    whole check N times from a COLD cache with `--quake 3` on, which is
    what the CI job does: a proof that passes once may be riding a
    lucky seed, and three cold runs of three seeds is cheap evidence
    that it is not.

    **The toolchain is a large download and is NOT a build dependency.**
    Nothing in `run.ps1`, `dotnet build`, or the ordinary CI matrix
    needs it — the extractions are committed precisely so a contributor
    with no interest in proofs never installs a prover. This script is
    the only thing that does.

    **Adding a module** is one entry in `$modules`: its source, its
    committed extraction, and its differential hosts — for each, the
    test project and Expecto list, and the case-count floor that list
    declares.
    Nothing else in this file names a module.

.PARAMETER Runs
    Repeat the check that many times from a cold cache, with
    `--quake 3`. Default 1. The CI job runs 3.

.PARAMETER SkipHost
    Skip step 6 (the differential hosts). The proofs, the extractions,
    the byte-diffs and the oracle build still run.

.PARAMETER FStarHome
    An F* installation to use instead of resolving the pin. Overrides
    $env:FSTAR_HOME. The version is REPORTED and, when it differs from
    the pin, called out loudly — a green run against an unpinned prover
    is a different claim from a green run against the pinned one.

# --- The modules -----------------------------------------------------
#
# One entry per proved model, in the order they landed. `Hosts` are
# its differential hosts. In each, `List` is the name of a TOP-LEVEL
# Expecto list, which every case under it carries as a prefix whatever
# separator Expecto joins names with — a filter that guesses the
# separator wrong matches nothing and reports success, so the shape
# that cannot guess wrong is the one used here. `MinCases` is the
# number of cases that list declares, asserted after the run for the
# reason step 6 gives. `Project` is the test project (under tests/)
# that holds the list. A later proof phase APPENDS its entry here.
#
# fuaran#2017: the first host of every module is at the toy witness, in
# `Fuaran.Program.Tests`, which reaches no UI type — the host the
# claims in proofs.json name. A UI-witness host follows where the
# model also describes the UI adapters' code; it leaves with them.

/// Phase 1716 — the interaction budget, modelled in F* and proved.
///
/// # What this module is
///
/// A hand-written model of `Budget.actionCascadeCost` and
/// `Budget.treeCost` (`src/Fuaran.Program.Bounded/Budget.fs`) and of the
/// G2 stage of the UI transport loop's `BoundedDriver.step` that consumes
/// them (in the UI tier's repository since Phase 2012), clause for
/// clause. Every definition below names its F# counterpart in the
/// comment above it. The differential host
/// (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Tests/ToyBudgetOracleTests.fs`, at the toy
/// witness since Phase 2017) runs the EXTRACTION of this module beside
/// production over trees that straddle the ceiling and over every action
/// shape the core accepts, nested, and requires the two to return the
/// same integer — that host is the only thing that says this model is
/// about the code that ships.
///
/// [Phase 1715](BoundedFold.fst) proves the other half of WS6.1(c): that
/// the interpreter invokes no closure a tree carries. Bounded CODE and
/// bounded COST are the two halves of running an untrusted tree on
/// shared infrastructure, and 1715's `proofs.json` says in as many words
/// that the budget is out of its theorem. This is that theorem.
///
/// # What is opaque, and why
///
/// Two things, and they are opaque for the two different reasons a model
/// has.
///
///   * **The saturation bound `mx`** — `System.Int32.MaxValue` in
///     production — is a PARAMETER. This model's integers are F*'s,
///     which are unbounded, so the .NET bound is not something the model
///     can be built out of; it is something the host supplies and the
///     theorems are quantified over. That is the honest statement, and
///     it is also the strongest one available: everything below holds
///     for every bound at all, so nothing here is an artefact of the
///     particular width production happens to have.
///   * **The per-node classification** — which `NodeKind` is
///     data-bearing and which of its fields carries the data — reaches
///     the model as a `cost_shape` the differential host projects.
///     `NodeKind` has scores of arms and none of them is this budget's
///     business: `nodeCost` reads exactly four of them and, from each,
///     exactly two numbers. Modelling the union would be modelling the
///     tree vocabulary, and the vocabulary is not what a budget is about.
///     What the model DOES own is the arithmetic performed on those two
///     numbers and the walk that accumulates it — which is what the
///     theorems are about, and what the host cannot supply.
///
/// The admitted branch of `step` is opaque for the first reason again:
/// what the driver does with an event it admits is 1715's subject and
/// the renderer's, and modelling it here would be modelling it twice.
///
/// One payload position is an opaque TYPE, and it is the assumed rung.
/// Production prices a `Binding.Static` payload with `Seq.truncate` over
/// a `seq`, which may be lazy and may be unbounded; a list is neither.
/// `payload` below is that list, and `counted` is the counting cap — so
/// what is proved is that the cap is applied and that the cost it
/// produces is bounded by it, never that a `seq` is finite.
///
/// # The theorems
///
///   * `sat_monotone` — the saturating add and multiply are monotone in
///     both arguments, never answer below zero, never answer above the
///     bound, and agree with ordinary arithmetic everywhere below it.
///     This is the clause the file's own comment stakes the budget on: a
///     cost is a budget comparand, and an overflow that wrapped NEGATIVE
///     would read as cheap and admit the very tree the budget exists to
///     refuse.
///   * `treecost_exact_below_ceiling` — when the walk's answer is at or
///     below the ceiling it is the EXACT cost, equal to what the same
///     walk with no ceiling at all would have returned. The early stop
///     costs nothing in the case where the number is used as a number.
///   * `treecost_strict_above_ceiling` — when the exact cost is above the
///     ceiling the walk's answer is above the ceiling too. The early stop
///     never turns a refusal into an admission, which is the only
///     direction that matters.
///   * `treecost_terminates` — the walk terminates on every finite tree,
///     carried by the `decreases` clause on `walk` rather than by a
///     depth counter, and the number of nodes it visits is bounded BOTH
///     by the size of the tree and by `ceiling + 1`. The second bound is
///     the ceiling acting as fuel: a tree ten thousand times over budget
///     costs the same as one marginally over, which is the claim
///     `treeCost`'s own comment makes.
///   * `breach_pure` — a breach mutates nothing. The session the driver
///     returns is the session it was given, the refusal is a named
///     outcome carrying its reason, and there are no patches and no
///     effects. Never a throw: the model has no exceptions, and the
///     `Tot` effect on `step` is what says production's total signature
///     is not merely a convention.
///   * `cascade_saturates_exact` (Phase 2018) — the cascade cost, over
///     every action shape the core accepts, is the EXACT price clipped at
///     the saturation bound: the price `BoundedFold.fst`'s `view_cost`
///     states — a sequence sums, a selection is one and its dearer arm, a
///     repeat is one and its body times its bound (a parameter bound at
///     the top of its range), an iteration is its lowered elements summed
///     — and never anything below it. The saturation can only ever make
///     a cascade price AT the bound, never cheaper.
///   * One law per flow shape, in a caller's terms (Phase 2018):
///     `choose_covers_either_arm` — a selection admitted under a cap has
///     either arm admitted under the cap less its own step;
///     `repeat_literal_is_unrolling` — a literal repeat is priced as its
///     bound step plus the sequence of its body that many times, and
///     `repeat_parameter_covers_every_count` — a parameter repeat is
///     priced at or above every count in its range; `each_is_elements` —
///     an iteration is priced as the sequence of its elements, and
///     `each_member_within` / `chain_member_within` — a sequence or an
///     iteration admitted under a cap has every member admitted under it.
///   * The declared quantity (Phase 2261, D54), `Budget.quantityCost`
///     over the same `act` with its leaves carrying an amount:
///     `quantity_saturates_exact` — the figure is the exact worst case
///     clipped at the bound; `quantity_monotone` — a tree whose leaves
///     declare more never prices cheaper, `sat_monotone` carried to the
///     quantity; the per-shape laws again (`quantity_choose_covers_either_
///     arm`, `quantity_repeat_parameter_covers_every_count`,
///     `quantity_each_is_elements`, `quantity_chain_member_within`,
///     `quantity_each_member_within`); `quantity_gate_exact` — a host's
///     ceiling admits a program whose leaves can spend at most it and
///     refuses one that can spend more, with the figure, deciding on a
///     `Tot` function of the action alone so nothing has run; and
///     `worked_example` — the acceptance's 30 + 3 × 20 + max(45, 0) = 135,

   from `FStar.Pervasives.Native` or `FStar.List.Tot` so the extraction
   references `Prims` and nothing else, exactly as `BoundedFold.fst`
   does. `oracle/Prims.fs` is that whole runtime; a model reaching for a

   SATURATING ARITHMETIC — `Budget.satAdd` / `Budget.satMul`.

   Production computes the sum and the product in `int64` and compares
   against `Int32.MaxValue` before narrowing. Over F*'s unbounded
   integers the widening step is the identity, so the model is the
   comparison alone — and the two agree on every input production can
   actually be handed, because an `int64` sum of two `Int32`s and an
   `int64` product of two `Int32`s both fit in `int64` with room to
   spare. That coincidence is what keeps the assumed rung narrow: the
   model is over a wider domain than production, not a different one.

   THE SIZE MEASURE.

   `treeCost` is ITERATIVE in production — an explicit stack, because a
   recursive walk would be bounded by the caller's stack rather than by
   the budget, so the function whose whole job is to bound a tree's cost
   would itself be what an over-deep tree could kill. The model keeps the
   stack, so it keeps the ORDER, which is what lets the differential host
   compare the exact integer rather than only the verdict: above the
   ceiling the answer depends on which nodes were visited first.

   A stack-shaped walk is not structurally recursive on anything, so it
   needs a measure. This is it: the total number of nodes still pending.
   Popping one node and pushing its children takes the measure down by
   exactly one, whatever the tree's shape.

   THE CASCADE COST — `Budget.actionCascadeCost`.

   The function reads an action through the witness's view and makes
   FIVE distinctions about it, one per composition shape the core
   accepts: a sequence, a selection (`Choose`, Phase 1976), a bounded
   repeat (`Repeat`, Phase 1976), a per-element iteration over a literal
   collection (`Each`, Phase 1990), and everything else — the assignment,
   the call, the guard and the leaf — which reaches one arm worth one.
   So the model carries exactly those five shapes, concretely, and the
   fourteen arms of the closed union — which `BoundedFold.fst` does
   carry, one for one — are not this model's subject.

   What each shape carries is what the pricing READS of it and nothing
   else, clause for clause with the F#: a selection its two arms (not its
   condition, which is one step whichever way it falls, nor its exit,
   which the price never reads); a repeat its bound — a literal count, or
   a parameter's range, of which only the TOP is read — and its body; an
   iteration its LOWERED elements, exactly as `BoundedFold.fst`'s `VEach`
   carries them, because production prices the list
   `ActionWitness.lowered` answers and never the collection or the
   placeholder. That makes the model exact over every tree the core
   accepts by construction: the host translates a tree into these shapes
   and the differential says whether the translation was honest.

   SATURATING, as production has been since Phase 1976 (before it, a
   `List.sumBy` over `int`, which this model was then careful not to
   saturate). Every add and multiply is `sat_add` / `sat_mul` over the
   same bound `mx` the walk uses, so a pathological repeat prices AT the
   bound rather than wrapping below it — the clause `cascade_saturates_
   exact` below turns into a theorem.

   THE EXACT PRICE, AND THAT THE CASCADE COST IS IT, CLIPPED.

   Ghost. `exact_cascade_cost` is the price with no bound at all — the
   same rule `BoundedFold.fst`'s `view_cost` states over the view, which
   `fold_steps_within_cost` proves bounds the steps a run takes. It is
   restated here over this model's `act` because the two models share no
   type (a deliberate separation, `proofs.json` `resource-bounds`), and
   what is proved is that production's saturating figure is this exact
   figure clipped at the bound — which is what lets a reader carry
   `fold_steps_within_cost`'s bound across to the number the gate reads:
   the gate's price is the exact price, or the bound, and never less.

   THE DECLARED QUANTITY — `Budget.quantityCost` (Phase 2261, D54).

   A step is the one quantity every domain spends; a device spends
   heater-minutes and a server spends money or egress bytes. A leaf
   DECLARES what it spends of a named quantity, and the same walk prices
   it with D35's rules and WITHOUT the step: a selection's condition, a
   repeat's bound and a stored collection's read spend none of it. So the
   model is `action_cascade_cost` with the `1`s removed and the leaf
   reading its amount — clause for clause with the F#, over the same
   `act`, so one translation of a tree serves both differentials.

   The parameters, and what the theorems assume of them. The AMOUNT a
   leaf carries is the witness's worst case for that leaf, read from the
   leaf's arguments by `View` — a literal is the amount, a parameter is
   the top of its range — and the core takes it as declared: nothing
   below proves a witness read its arguments honestly, exactly as
   nothing in the fold theorem proves a `View` is honest. The NAME and
   UNIT being priced are the host's projection: one `act` is one
   (name, unit), and a leaf declaring another pair is `ALeaf 0` here.
   The SATURATION BOUND `mx` is the parameter it is everywhere in this
   module. A negative amount is `clamp_nat`ed, as a negative bound is.

   TERMINATION, AND THE WORK IT TAKES.

   `walk` is `Tot`, so it terminates: that is not a lemma below, it is
   the `decreases (forest_size pending)` clause on the definition itself,
   discharged when the module checks. What the lemmas add is the BOUND —
   and the second of the two is the interesting one, because it is
   bounded by the ceiling rather than by the tree.

/// Phase 1715 — the shared bounded fold, modelled in F* and proved.
/// Phase 1898 — the same fold restated over the ACTION VIEW of the
/// generic tier (DECISIONS.md D18, `docs/generic-tier.md` §3), written
/// before the code that will meet it (D14).
///
/// # What this module is
///
/// Two layers, one file.
///
/// **The generic tier** — a model of the fold the generic core will run,
/// `BoundedActions.run witness` (Phase 1896 writes it): one `match` over
/// the shapes of D18's `ActionView` — four at the cut, FIVE since Phase
/// 1967 added the halting guard `Require` (the second witness's F1),
/// SEVEN since Phase 1976 added the selection `Choose` and the bounded
/// iteration `Repeat` that D1 and D2 charter (the second witness's
/// re-run found the core had sequence and abort but neither) —
/// parameterised by a WITNESS record that is the fold-read members of
/// `ProgramWitness`. Phase 1896 wrote the F# against the four-shape
/// model; Phase 1967 restated and re-proved this model over five shapes
/// BEFORE the port that followed (D14 again), and the one law the fifth
/// shape changes is the sequence homomorphism, which gains a halting
/// clause that is vacuous for every view without a guard. Phase 1976
/// restated it again over seven, before its port: the two new shapes
/// are COMPOSITION shapes, so the structural characterisation
/// (`fold_total`) excludes them as it excludes a sequence; the halting
/// clause now has three sources (`fold_no_halting_shape_no_halt`); a
/// repeat is its own unrolling (`repeat_is_unrolling`); and the fragment
/// of the view that can run BACKWARDS is named, decided from the tree,
/// and proved to undo itself (`reverse_run`, section 6 below). EIGHT
/// since Phase 1990 added `Each`, per-element iteration over a LITERAL
/// collection, seen here LOWERED: the view carries the body once per
/// element with that element substituted for the placeholder — the
/// substitution is the witness's (`ActionWitness.Substitute`), as `View`
/// and `Lower` are, because the fold cannot see inside an action — and
/// the fold runs the sequence of those elements. Every theorem below
/// extends over it as over a sequence, and `each_is_lowering` (section 9)
/// is the equation: an `Each` folds, traces, reverses and prices exactly
/// as the sequence of its elements. Since Phase 2441 the witness also
/// DECLARES how its refusals read (`w_refusals`, D18's
/// `ActionWitness.Refusals`): under `Continues`, today's reading and the
/// UI tier's, a refusal is a diagnostic the sequence carries on past;
/// under `Halts` — the reading a leaf-gating witness over an actuator
/// declares — every refusal halts, and a halted RUN is all or nothing:
/// the entry store, no effect, and the refusal the last word
/// (`halting_run_all_or_nothing`, section 12). The shapes do not move;
/// one constructor (`refusal`) reads the declaration, and `run_action`
/// settles a halted run under it. A witness declaring `Continues` folds
/// exactly as before the declaration existed (`continuing_run_is_fold`).
/// Every definition is captioned with the D18 contract member it models
/// (§3.2 the action view, §3.3 expressions, §3.4 the store).
///
/// **The UI witness** — today's fourteen-arm `Action` union seen THROUGH
/// the view: `ui_view` is the adapter's total `View`, `ui_lower` its
/// `Lower`, and `run` is `run_action` at that witness, with the exact
/// signature Phase 1715 gave it. The differential host
/// (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Parity.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs`) runs the
/// EXTRACTION of `run` beside `BoundedActions.runBoundedActionWith` over
/// the conformance corpus's driver-semantics family and an arm-complete
/// action corpus, and requires the store, the effect list and the
/// diagnostics to agree at every step — that host is the only thing that
/// says this model is about the code that ships. It runs unchanged on
/// this restatement, which is the claim that the fourteen arms seen
/// through the view ARE the fourteen arms.
///
/// # Every parameter of the model is an assumption
///
/// The generic fold takes one witness and one placement arm. What each
/// arrow is assumed to be, and which theorem leans on it:
///
///   * `w_view` (D18 `ActionWitness.View`) — a TOTAL arrow. Here the
///     view is taken to exhaustion (`action_view` is a tree), so the
///     obligation that the F# `View`, applied repeatedly, unfolds a finite
///     tree is carried by this field's type: a witness whose `View` put an
///     action inside its own `Sequence` could not be written here. The UI
///     witness discharges it by `ui_view` being accepted as `Tot`.
///     Every theorem below leans on it, since every theorem is about
///     `fold` over a finite view.
///   * `w_lower` (D18 `ActionWitness.Lower`) — a total arrow whose
///     RESULT TYPE is the kept assumption K3: at most one effect, or a
///     refusal, or a decline, and no store. A leaf that wrote the store
///     or emitted a list cannot be expressed. `fold_total` states what
///     that buys.
///   * `w_describe` (D18 `ActionWitness.Describe`) — a total arrow; the
///     diagnostics carry its answer verbatim.
///   * `w_resolve` (D18 `ExprWitness.Resolve`) — a total pure arrow, the
///     same answer for the same store. Nothing proved here depends on
///     what it answers, only on the fold consulting it where it does.
///   * `w_is_reserved` / `w_reserved_prefix` (D18 `StoreWitness`) — a
///     total predicate and a constant (K5). `fold_reserved_untouched` is
///     quantified over every such predicate.
///   * `w_refusals` (D18 `ActionWitness.Refusals`, Phase 2441) — a
///     CONSTANT of the witness, one of two readings, declared once and
///     read by `refusal` and by `run_action`. It is what makes
///     `halting_run_all_or_nothing` a theorem about a declaration rather
///     than about a placement's wrapper: every theorem above it is
///     quantified over both readings, and `may_halt` names it.
///   * `answer` (the placement arm, `HandlerArm.Answer`) — what a call
///     MEANS at this placement, opaque. `fold_total` names the answered
///     case and excludes it; `fold_reserved_untouched` carries the seam's
///     obligation `arm_preserves_reserved` as a hypothesis, which
///     `inert_preserves_reserved` discharges for the arm that declines.
///
/// **No-closure-invocation is an obligation on the witness, stated as a
/// precondition (D18).** The core holds no closure: nothing in the view
/// is one, and the fold reads an action only through `w_describe`,
/// `w_lower` and the shape `w_view` gave it. `fold_blind` proves that
/// half UNCONDITIONALLY — two views of the same shape whose actions
/// describe and lower alike fold identically. `blind_to` states the
/// witness's half — a relation on actions under which `w_view` produces
/// same-shaped views — and `run_action_blind` is the theorem conditional
/// on it. `ui_blind_to_closures` discharges that obligation for the UI
/// witness under `same_but_closures`, so `run_no_closure` — Phase 1715's
/// statement, word for word — is again unconditional.
///
/// # The store is modelled concretely, on purpose
///
/// D18 §3.4 makes the store abstract behind `StoreWitness.Assign`. The
/// model keeps a concrete keyed channel (an association list, `write`),
/// because `fold_reserved_untouched` is a theorem ABOUT what is written,
/// and a theorem about writes to an abstract store would be a theorem
/// about an obligation nobody had stated. What the model claims of a
/// domain's `Assign` is therefore K4: one keyed state channel where an
/// assignment writes one key. A store whose `Assign` did something else
/// is outside this model, and the differential host's projection of the
/// domain store onto this channel is where that is checked.
///
/// # The theorems
///
///   Generic tier (over the view):
///   * `fold_total` — every view shape is named, with no wildcard; one
///     step that is neither `VSequence` nor an ANSWERED call leaves the
///     placement untouched, leaves the store identical or writes exactly
///     one key the reserved predicate rejects, and emits at most one
///     effect and at most one diagnostic (K3, as a theorem).
///   * `fold_blind` / `run_action_blind` — the core half and the
///     conditional whole of no-closure-invocation, above.
///   * `sequence_homomorphism` — `fold_many (app xs ys) s` is
///     `fold_many ys` applied to the store `fold_many xs s` left, effects
///     and diagnostics concatenated in order. DECISIONS.md D7's splice
///     property, as an equation, now over `VSequence`.
///   * `fold_reserved_untouched` — the output store agrees with the input
///     at every reserved key, for any arm that preserves them.
///   * `halting_run_all_or_nothing` (Phase 2441) — under a witness that
///     declares `Halts`, and an arm whose answers refuse nothing, a run
///     either did not halt — and then it is the fold's own outcome and
///     met no refusal — or it halted, and then its store is the entry
///     store, it emitted nothing, and its last diagnostic is the refusal
///     that halted it. `continuing_run_is_fold` is the other half: under
///     `Continues` a run IS the fold, as before the declaration existed.
///
///   The UI witness (each a corollary of the generic theorem at
///   `ui_witness`, keeping its Phase-1715 name and statement):
///   * `run_total`, `run_no_closure`, `chain_homomorphism`,
///     `reserved_untouched`, `inert_preserves_reserved`.
///
/// Nothing about the browser placement, the durable journal, or the
/// per-connection session cells is modelled.

   THE FOLD — `BoundedActions.run witness` (Phase 1896), one `match`
   over the five view shapes. It owns sequencing, the one store write,
   the reserved-namespace refusal (K5), D9's refusal of a declared result
   target, D7's handler-effect arm, and — since Phase 1967 — the halting
   guard. It never recurses into a leaf.

   Termination is structural on the view. `fold`, `fold_many` and
   `fold_repeat` are mutually recursive with a three-place lexicographic
   measure: the list inside `VSequence` and the arms of `VChoose` are
   strict subterms of the view, each element is a strict subterm of the
   list, and a repeat descends into its body (a strict subterm) with the
   remaining count as the last place — so a bounded iteration terminates
   by its bound, as D2 says it must, with no fuel the code does not have.

// ─── 6. The reversible fragment (Phase 1976) ─────────────────────────

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Selection and iteration are where a reversible language needs
   structure a forward-only one does not, so the two shapes were designed
   for reversal from the start (the Janus model, Lutz and Yokoyama): a
   branch carries an EXIT assertion that picks the arm to undo, and a
   repeat's bound is a function of the tree alone. `Assign` is not
   reversible by construction — it destroys the old value — so it joins
   the fragment BY TRACE: a reversible run records, at each write, the
   value it overwrote (the Bennett embedding), and the inverse program
   restores it with an ordinary `Assign`. Nothing is recorded by a run
   that is not asked to trace (`fold` carries no trace, `traced_agrees`
   says the two runs agree), so a program that never reverses pays
   nothing.

   The fragment is SYNTACTIC — `reversible` reads the tree and nothing
   else — and it is: sequence, assign, the guard, a branch WITH an exit
   assertion, a repeat with a LITERAL bound. A call and a leaf are effects
   and are 1977's boundary; a branch without an exit assertion has nothing
   to say which arm to undo; a parameter bound is read from the store the
   body may have overwritten. The one thing the fragment cannot decide
   from the tree is whether every key a run assigned was PRESENT before
   it: a key that was absent cannot be restored by an assignment (the
   store has no delete, K4), so the trace says `TWrote ONone` and
   `restorable` refuses it. That is a property of the run, carried by
   the trace, and `reverse_run` is conditional on it — named as such in
   the ladder.

// ─── 9. An `Each` is the sequence of its elements (Phase 1990) ────────

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Per-element iteration over a literal collection is VOCABULARY that
   lowers to the core by substitution (D1): the witness substitutes each
   element of the collection for the placeholder in the body, and what
   the core runs is the sequence of the results. The view carries the
   lowered form (`VEach act elements`), so the theorem below is an
   EQUATION between two views over the same elements, and every sequence
   law — the homomorphism, the reserved-key invariant, the halting
   clause, the reversal, the cost bound — is a law about an `Each` with
   no further proof. What the model does NOT own is the substitution
   itself: `ActionWitness.Substitute` is a witness arrow, like `View`
   and `Lower`, and the obligation that it preserves the body's shape is
   stated in the ladder and tested at the toy witness, where the
   differential host runs production (which substitutes as it folds)
   beside this model (handed the elements already substituted).

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Per-element iteration over a collection the STORE holds (D36). The
   view still carries the lowered form — the elements the host
   substituted over the extent it read — and what the model ADDS is the
   read: the source resolved once at entry through `w_resolve`, read as
   a collection through `w_as_elements`, and the ceiling checked against
   what it answered before the first element. So the equation with
   `VEach` is CONDITIONAL on the store holding the extent the view was
   lowered over — the differential host's obligation, stated — and the
   refusal over the ceiling runs nothing. The trace records the extent
   the arrow ANSWERED, which is how the model says "recorded".

// ─── 12. The halting reading (Phase 2441) ────────────────────────────

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A witness over an actuator needs a plan to be ALL OR NOTHING: a run
   that performed two actuations and refused the third has left the
   device in a state the plan never described, which is exactly the
   partial actuation an attacker wants. Under `Continues` the fold keeps
   what was emitted before a refusal, by design — an inert UI action is
   harmless, and the chain carrying on is the UI tier's contract
   (`ui_never_halts`). So the reading is DECLARED per witness
   (`w_refusals`), read at every refusal (`refusal`) and once more at the
   run's end (`settle`), and this section is what the declaration buys.

   The theorem is about the RUN (`run_action`), because the run is the
   unit an actuator dispatches. The fold's own steps keep their prefix
   semantics under both readings — a composition still carries the
   members that ran before the halt, as `sequence_homomorphism` says —
   which is what lets every theorem above stand over both readings with
   its hypothesis reading the declaration where it must (`may_halt`).
   The arm hypothesis is the same shape as `arm_preserves_reserved`: a
   placement's answer is opaque, so what it reports is assumed rather
   than proved, and `inert_arm_refuses_nothing` discharges it for the
   placements that run no handlers.

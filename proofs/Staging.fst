/// Phase 1717 — two-phase staging, modelled in F* and proved: the
/// residual of a failed handler is at most a prefix of its host calls.
///
/// # What this module is
///
/// A hand-written model of `Handler.run`
/// (`src/Fuaran.Program.Server/Handler.fs`) — the PLAN phase (`runStage`
/// / `runEffect`, the five effect arms and the `Compute` arm), the phase
/// boundary (the one `if`), the PERFORM phase (`perform`) and the two
/// outcome constructors — clause for clause, with the PERFORMER left
/// abstract. Every definition below names its F# counterpart in the
/// comment above it. The differential host
/// (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Server.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs`) runs the
/// EXTRACTION of this module beside production over the staging cases
/// the handler's own suites drive, with a scripted performer that fails
/// at every position of every staged list, and requires the two to
/// return the same outcome — that host is the only thing that says this
/// model is about the code that ships.
///
/// Since Phase 1967 the staged list may hold OPS as well as host calls:
/// a placement that registers an op performer (`r_op_perform`,
/// `OpPerformance.Performed` in F#) makes `ApplyOps` a staged arm, its
/// ops applied in memory while planning and performed one staged call
/// per op in plan order. Nothing in the perform phase changed for it —
/// an op's staged call is a staged call with no landing slot — which is
/// why every theorem below is stated over the staged list as before and
/// re-proves unchanged; `plan_pure` gained the one clause that matters,
/// that the plan phase reads only WHETHER an op performer is registered
/// and what it stages, never what it answers. Without one (`ONone`, the
/// UI tier) the arm is exactly what it was.
///
/// Since Phase 1974 (the third witness, DECISIONS.md D20) the `ApplyOps`
/// arm reads two things more of the STATE axis, and both are clauses of
/// that one arm (`plan_ops`). The op witness VIEWS each op (`w_op_view`):
/// an op viewed as `ORequire` is the op-channel GUARD — resolved through
/// its own apply against the state as of that point in the plan, holding
/// without moving the state and refusing with its reason verbatim, and
/// never staged (F-GUARD). And a registered op performer stages each
/// edit FROM THE STATE AS OF THAT OP — the planned state with the op
/// applied — so the performer is handed the state the plan produced
/// rather than re-deriving it (F-PERFORM). The landing-slot check reads
/// one arrow, `w_slot_refused`, so a composition with no binding channel
/// (no dispatch axis) refuses every slot through the clause a reserved
/// slot is refused through. Every earlier theorem is restated over the
/// arm as it now is and keeps its statement; `guard_holds_moves_nothing`,
/// `guard_refusal_halts` and `performer_handed_the_plan` are new.
///
/// Since Phase 1976 the op view has FOUR shapes, and is taken to
/// exhaustion as the dispatch axis's view is: an op the state witness
/// views as a BRANCH (`OChoose`) carries two arms of ops and an entry
/// condition that is itself an op resolved through `w_apply` — `ROk`
/// takes the true arm, `RErr` the false arm, so a domain's typed refusal
/// is the false value, not a halt — and an optional EXIT assertion
/// resolved against the state the arm left, which must hold after the
/// true arm and fail after the false arm, or the arm's plan is refused
/// with the assertion named; an op viewed as a REPEAT (`ORepeat`) plans
/// its body `count` times. Neither condition is ever applied for its
/// state, staged, or performed: a branch plans exactly as the arm it
/// takes (`choose_plans_the_taken_arm`), a repeat exactly as its
/// unrolling (`repeat_plans_as_unrolling`), and the earlier theorems
/// keep their statements over the widened arm.
///
/// Since Phase 1990 the op view has FIVE shapes: an op the state witness
/// views as a PER-ELEMENT ITERATION over a literal collection (`OEach`)
/// is seen LOWERED — one body of ops per element, the element substituted
/// for the placeholder by the witness's `Substitute`, in collection order
/// — and plans as the concatenation of those bodies
/// (`each_plans_as_lowered`). The model does not substitute: it cannot see
/// inside an op, so substitution is the witness's exactly as `View` is,
/// and every theorem below extends over the shape as over a sequence.
///
/// Since Phase 1980 the DURABLE DISCIPLINE (DECISIONS.md D12, restated
/// by D23) is modelled beside the handler, at the foot of this module:
/// `Durable.runWith` wraps every performer the perform phase reaches —
/// a host call's and, under a registered op performer, the op's — so a
/// staged call's ordinal is its position in the one staged list, and
/// what the wrapper does at an ordinal is decided by a journal SNAPSHOT
/// read once at entry (`journal`, `decide`): serve a recorded answer,
/// invoke the performer, or refuse. `replay` is the perform phase run
/// through that wrapper and `durable_run` is `run` with it; an op
/// stage's entry carries the op's content address as its SUBJECT, read
/// off the state axis, so two ops at one ordinal are told apart by the
/// divergence check. The plan phase is untouched by all of it, which is
/// `plan_pure` once more: the wrapper changes `r_perf`'s behaviour and
/// nothing the plan phase reads, so every theorem above re-proves
/// unchanged over the same staged list.
///
/// DECISIONS.md D8 states the law in prose: nothing external runs in the
/// plan phase; an uncommitted outcome equals the entry state EXCEPT that
/// `Performed` names exactly the prefix of staged host calls that ran;
/// and `Performed` is execution order. `HandlerLoopTests` pins instances
/// of it. "At most a prefix" quantifies over every staged sequence and
/// every point of failure, which is what instances cannot cover and what
/// the next handler arm can silently break — so it is proved here.
///
/// # What is opaque, and why
///
/// The handler is generic in its tree, its bindings, its values, its
/// ops, its actions and its client effects, and this model keeps every
/// one of them a type parameter — `t`, `b`, `v`, `o`, `q`, `a`, `eff`,
/// `d` — because nothing the theorems say depends on what any of them
/// is. What production does WITH them reaches the model through two
/// records of arrows:
///
///   * the `witness` — the store witness's `LandQuery` / `Assign` /
///     `IsReserved` / `ReservedPrefix` (the last two as one slot-refusal
///     arrow since Phase 1974), the state witness's `Apply` and `View`, the
///     shared fold's `runInert` (Phase 1715's subject, so opaque here),
///     and the query evaluator. The evaluator and `LandQuery` arrive as
///     ONE arrow, `w_query`, because one opaque composed with another is
///     one opaque and the clause the handler owns is halt-or-land;
///   * the `registry` — the gate, the argument policy, the performer
///     LOOKUP and the performer's BEHAVIOUR, split in two. Production's
///     `HostFunctions` map goes from a name to a closure; the model goes
///     from a name to an opaque token `p` and, separately, from a token
///     and an argument to a result. The plan phase captures the token
///     and the perform phase applies the behaviour, and keeping the two
///     apart is what lets `plan_pure` be STATED: the plan phase's output
///     is the same under every behaviour the performers could have.
///
/// The performer is the one genuinely effectful seam, and it is the
/// assumed rung: the model's `r_perf` is a pure function of the call, so
/// a stateful production performer is represented by the verdicts it
/// actually returned, in the order the perform phase asked for them. The
/// perform phase asks each staged call exactly once, in declaration
/// order — which is a property the EXTRACTION inherits, so the
/// differential host's counter-driven performer exercises exactly the
/// case the pure model cannot state.
///
/// The denial sink (`OnDenied`) is a unit-returning observer and is not
/// modelled. The durable journal's READ side (D12) is modelled since
/// Phase 1980 — a snapshot of decided ordinals, below — and its WRITES
/// and its storage are the host's port and out of the theorem, as
/// `proofs.json` records.
///
/// # The theorems
///
///   * `plan_pure` — the plan phase's output is a function of the entry
///     state, the program, the witness and the registry's gate, policy
///     and lookup ALONE: replacing the performers' behaviour by any
///     other leaves it equal. This is D8's "nothing external runs in the
///     plan phase" as an equation.
///   * `residual_is_prefix` — when the plan completed and the performer
///     fails at position `k` of the staged list, the outcome's store is
///     the entry store, it is uncommitted, it carries no patches, no
///     notifications and no client effects, and `Performed` is EXACTLY
///     the first `k` staged capabilities, in order.
///   * `performed_in_order` — the general statement both of the above
///     and `commit_is_total_prefix` are corollaries of: for EVERY
///     performer, `Performed` is the plan phase's capabilities in stage
///     order (on commit; nothing on rollback) followed by the staged
///     capabilities that ran, in declaration order, and the handler
///     commits exactly when all of them ran.
///   * `commit_is_total_prefix` — when every staged call succeeds the
///     handler commits and `Performed` ends with the WHOLE staged list.
///
/// `plan_halt_performs_nothing` is the supporting clause: a handler that
/// halted while planning reports nothing performed at all, because
/// nothing reached the perform phase.
///
/// Beside them (Phase 1974):
///
///   * `guard_holds_moves_nothing` — an op-channel guard that holds is
///     invisible to the plan: the ops after it are planned against the
///     SAME state, and nothing is staged for it.
///   * `guard_refusal_halts` — an op-channel guard that refuses refuses
///     the whole op sequence with its own reason, verbatim, whatever
///     follows it; the effect halts on that reason and stages nothing
///     (`plan_halt_performs_nothing` lifts it to the handler).
///   * `performer_handed_the_plan` — under a registered op performer, the
///     last staged edit of a planned op sequence was staged from the
///     sequence's FINAL planned state: the performer is handed what the
///     plan produced and needs to fold nothing itself.
///
/// And beside those (Phase 1976, the two flow shapes on the op axis):
///
///   * `choose_plans_the_taken_arm` — a branch whose exit assertion is
///     absent or agrees with the arm taken plans exactly as that arm: the
///     conditions move nothing and stage nothing.
///   * `exit_violation_halts` — a branch whose exit assertion disagrees
///     with the arm it took refuses the whole op sequence with the
///     assertion named, after the arm planned; the effect halts on that
///     reason and nothing is performed (`plan_halt_performs_nothing`).
///   * `repeat_plans_as_unrolling` — a repeat plans exactly as its body
///     written out `count` times, so every sequence law covers it.
///   * `staged_from_the_final_state` — `performer_handed_the_plan`'s
///     guarantee over EVERY shape: whenever a planned sequence staged
///     anything, the head of the staged list was staged from the
///     sequence's final planned state. (`last_edit`, which the older
///     theorem is stated through, answers `ONone` on a sequence with a
///     branch or a repeat in it, so that theorem is vacuous there and this
///     one is not.)
///
/// And at the foot of the module (Phase 1980, the durable discipline,
/// over the staged list with a journal snapshot `dur` and an ordinal `k`):
///
///   * `replay_unrun_is_perform` — over calls the journal has nothing
///     for, the replay IS the perform phase, and the performer is invoked
///     at exactly the ordinals the perform phase asks.
///   * `replay_serves_completed` — a prefix the journal records as
///     completed is served: landed from the record, no performer asked,
///     its ordinals reported as replayed.
///   * `resume_performs_only_the_rest` — the two together: a completed
///     prefix is served and only the rest is performed.
///   * `indeterminate_refused_by_default` — an undecided step under an
///     undeclared performer with the opt-in off is refused, before it
///     and everything after it, under `durable-indeterminate-step`.
///   * `indeterminate_reinvoked_only_by_name` — it is re-invoked in
///     exactly two cases, a declared-idempotent performer (no override)
///     or the opt-in (an override recorded), and nowhere else.
///   * `divergence_refused` — an ordinal whose recorded identity is not
///     this call's is refused under `durable-replay-divergence`; the
///     subject is what tells two ops at one ordinal apart.
///   * `durable_resume` — the discipline at the handler: served prefix,
///     invoked rest, committed exactly when the rest ran.
///   * `empty_journal_is_direct` — with nothing recorded, the durable
///     run's outcome is the direct run's.
///
/// And the plan's ENTRY READ (Phase 2165, D39 — a read the plan phase
/// makes of the world through the run's `EntryReader`, journaled at its
/// own ordinal through the same wrapper; `entry_read`):
///
///   * `entry_read_served` — a read the journal records as completed,
///     under the read's identity, is answered the RECORDED value whatever
///     the live world answers: the resumed plan observes the journaled
///     entry and never the live world.
///   * `entry_read_diverged_refused` — a read at an ordinal whose recorded
///     identity is not this read's is refused under
///     `durable-entry-read-diverged` naming the read, whatever the live
///     world and the journal's value say: a resume that would plan
///     differently is a typed refusal, never the domain's own.
///   * `entry_read_unrun_is_live` — with nothing recorded the read is the
///     live read: a first run reads the world.
///   * `resumed_plan_observes_entry` — at the plan: a plan built over the
///     served read is the plan built over the recorded value, for every
///     live world — two re-entries against two worlds plan alike.
///
/// And the STAGED READ and the REPORT (Phase 2212, DECISIONS.md D47 —
/// the two arms the suites pinned and no theorem did, D44 and D45). The
/// registry carries the host's query posture (`r_query_posture`, read
/// off `ServerEffectRegistry.queryPosture`) and what a reaching read is
/// staged as (`r_query_stage`, split as `r_op_perform` is); a staged
/// call's landing is production's `Landing` (`landing`: nowhere, a
/// state slot, a query slot, the last through `w_land_query`); `Report`
/// is a seventh effect arm carrying a concrete `finding`, recorded
/// through `r_record` into `ac_findings` / `oc_findings`:
///
///   * `pure_read_plans_while_planning` — under `PureRead` an admitted
///     read is asked while planning and lands there, or halts: the arm
///     as it was before the seam, as an equation.
///   * `pure_read_reads_no_stage` — under `PureRead` the whole plan is
///     the same under every staging arrow — "exactly as before".
///   * `staged_read_stages_one_call` — under `Reaching` an admitted read
///     stages exactly one call, landing in its query slot, records
///     `TReached "RunQuery"`, and touches nothing else.
///   * `staged_read_asks_no_evaluator` — the read's stage is the same
///     under every `w_query`: the evaluator is not asked while planning.
///   * `staged_read_not_asked_on_resume` — a completed read is served,
///     the performer invoked only at the ordinals after it, the record
///     landed in the query slot.
///   * `report_records_and_moves_nothing` / `report_refused_halts` — an
///     admitted report records its finding and touches nothing else, or
///     halts on the recorder's refusal.
///   * `findings_in_program_order` — the outcome's findings, on commit
///     and on rollback, are the plan's in stage order; the perform phase
///     adds none.
///   * `finding_served` / `finding_diverged_refused` /
///     `different_finding_refused` / `finding_unrun_is_live` — the
///     journaled finding (`journal_finding`, the durable recorder at an
///     ordinal, on the entry read's terms): served from its record,
///     refused where the record is another's, live where there is none.

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE DURABLE DISCIPLINE (Phase 1980) — `Durable.runWith`
   (`src/Fuaran.Program.Server/Durable.fs`), modelled BESIDE the handler
   it wraps and over the same staged list.

   Not ghost: the definitions down to `durable_run` are extracted, and
   the differential host in `DurableInterpreterTests` runs them beside
   production. The lemmas after them are erased, as every lemma above is.

   What is modelled is the READ side of D12's discipline: the journal as
   a snapshot taken once at entry (production reads
   `services.Journal.Read invocation` once and lets that snapshot
   decide), and what the wrapped performer does at each ordinal of the
   perform phase — serve a recorded answer, invoke the performer, or
   refuse. Since Phase 1980 a staged call may be an OP STAGE as well as
   a host call, and the discipline is the same for both: the ordinal is
   the position in the one staged list, and the identity a replay
   checks is the capability with, for an op stage, the op's content
   address (`d_subject`). The journal's WRITES — the attempt before the
   performer and the decision after — and its storage are the host's
   port and stay out of the theorem, as the ladder records.

(* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The plan's ENTRY READ (Phase 2165, D39).

   `Durable.runReading` hands the witness an `EntryReader` bound to the
   run: a read the plan makes of the world — inside the state witness's
   `Apply`, which the model keeps opaque — goes through the SAME wrapper
   the staged calls go through, at an ordinal of its own in the one
   cursor sequence, under the capability `ReadEntry` with the read's name
   as its subject, declared idempotent (a read repeats freely) and asked
   no operator refusal. `entry_read` is that wrapper's answer to the
   plan, clause for clause with `wrapAt` under those settings: the
   divergence check first, then the recorded value or refusal, and the
   live read where the journal has nothing or could not decide. Where it
   diverges the refusal NAMES the read, which is what the handler's halt
   carries — never the domain's own "nothing matched", which is what a
   re-plan against the moved world used to produce.

   What the plan does WITH the value is the host's `Apply` and stays out
   of the model, as `w_apply` already is; the theorems are about what the
   plan is ANSWERED, and `resumed_plan_observes_entry` lifts that to any
   witness built over the answer.

   THE STAGED READ ON RESUME, AND THE JOURNALED FINDING (Phase 2212;
   D34, D44, D45).

   A reaching read is a staged call, so the durable discipline above
   already decides it: what is new is stated — the read's ordinal served,
   the evaluator not asked, the record landed in the QUERY slot. A
   finding is recorded while PLANNING, through the recorder the durable
   interpreter installs as `RecordFinding` (`Durable.runGuarded`'s
   `journalFinding`): the same wrapper the entry read goes through, at an
   ordinal of its own in the one cursor sequence, under `Report` with the
   finding's content address as its subject, declared idempotent and
   asked no operator refusal, the finding ENCODED as the recorded value
   and the record DECODED back. `journal_finding` is that wrapper's
   answer, clause for clause with `wrapAt` under those settings. The
   codec (`Finding.encode` / `Finding.decode`) and the content address
   (`Finding.subject`) are the host's and arrive as arrows; every theorem
   below that needs a property of them names it as a hypothesis.

/// Phase 1977 — the undo posture, modelled in F* and proved: a handler
/// classed reversible from its declared form is undone to its entry
/// state by running the inverses of the plan in reverse plan order; one
/// classed compensable reaches the compensated state; and the first step
/// an undo cannot perform is named exactly, before anything is undone.
///
/// # What this module is
///
/// The undo half of the server placement, over Phase 1717's handler
/// model: `Undo.posture` (`src/Fuaran.Program.Server/Undo.fs`) read off
/// a handler's stages and the state witness's `Undo` member, and
/// `Undo.run`, which takes the TRAIL a committed `Handler.runPlanned`
/// recorded — every edit with the state it was applied to, every compute
/// stage with what restores its binding writes, every step that reached
/// the world — and performs the inverses (or the declared compensations)
/// through the SAME handler, the same gate, the same argument policy and
/// the same registered performers the forward run used. Nothing here
/// re-models the handler: this module `open`s `Staging` and proves over
/// its `run`, its `plan_ops` and its trail, exactly as `EffectGate.fst`
/// proves over its gate. What is new at runtime is the member, the
/// classifier, the trail and the one undo run; the differential host
/// (`tests/Fuaran.Program.Server.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs`, the
/// `Phase 1977` list) runs the extraction of this module beside
/// production over the staging corpus with the scripted performer
/// refusing at every position of the undo's own staged list.
///
/// # The member the model argues for
///
/// The phase's shape to argue against was `Undo: 'Op -> 'Node ->
/// UndoClass<'Op>`, the class computed against the pre-state. The model
/// argues for the CLASS as a function of the op alone and the INVERSE
/// as a function of the pre-state — `Undo: 'Op -> UndoClass<'Node,
/// 'Op>` with `Inverse of ('Node -> 'Op list)` — for one reason the
/// theorems make exact: the posture is read BEFORE the run, from the
/// declared form, where no pre-state exists, and `undo_run_restores`
/// ties that static reading to the dynamic trail only because the class
/// the posture read of an op is the class the undo meets for the same
/// op, whatever state it was applied to. A member whose case could
/// depend on the state would need a coherence assumption the type now
/// carries for free. The inverse is a LIST because the UI witness's
/// inverse is a diff, and a diff is a list.
///
/// # What is opaque, and why
///
/// Everything `Staging.fst` keeps opaque stays so. The class arrow
/// (`cls`, production's `StateWitness.Undo`) is a parameter, and the one
/// law a reversible undo rests on is stated as a hypothesis and named in
/// every theorem that needs it: `inverse_law`, that an op's declared
/// inverse, computed from the state the op was applied to, applies to
/// the state the op produced and answers the state it was applied to.
/// That law is the witness's obligation (docs/generic-tier.md §3.5, K9),
/// as K4's read-after-write law is for `Read`. A compute stage's
/// restorer is opaque (`w_undo_compute`): what undoes the fold's binding
/// writes is BoundedFold's `reverse_run` (Phase 1976), proved there and
/// applied here, never re-proved.
///
/// Since Phase 2212 (DECISIONS.md D47) the static posture reads the
/// HOST's query posture, as production's does: `stage_defects` takes a
/// REQUIRED `query_posture` and names a read under a reaching evaluator
/// `StagedQuery`, graded one-way; `replay_defect` and
/// `replay_defects_of_effect` are the effect-axis half of
/// `HandlerWire.replayReasons`, so "both closed vocabularies name
/// `staged-query`" is a theorem (`staged_read_named_in_both_vocabularies`)
/// rather than a reading; a report names no defect in either
/// (`report_names_no_defect`); and `staged_read_undo_refused` is the
/// static-dynamic agreement `StagedQueryPostureTests` pins, as a theorem
/// over the model. The posture-bearing theorems (`plan_clear`,
/// `undo_run_restores`) read the posture off the registry the run is
/// given, so the static side and the run consult one fact.
